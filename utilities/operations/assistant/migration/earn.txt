After a user reserves a campaign, this modal window presents the requirements, eligibility criteria, and terms associated with the campaign. It provides essential information such as the sponsor's details, reward amount, and legal agreements, ensuring that users understand the conditions before proceeding with their submission. Since the campaign has already been reserved, the option to reserve it is no longer available within this modal.

The selection of cards is limited to 30 days.
Fraud detection Page Overview:

# Earn. Blacklist
To combat spam and fraud, campaign sponsors need a tool to manage blacklists:
- Blacklist - a list of users who will not be able to take part in this sponsor's campaigns.
- References - links to blacklists of other sponsors (taking into account one more level of nesting so that you can have blacklist aggregators).
- Whitelist is a list of users who can participate in campaigns, even if they are included in other blacklists.
At the top of the page there is a navbar with three tabs.
## Blacklist

This feature helps maintain the integrity of the campaigns by ensuring that users who should not participate are effectively managed.

# Match bots are services implemented on the Waivio platform that automatically vote on content produced by specific authors or content based on specific criteria. There are three types of match bots: Authors Match Bot, Curators Match Bot, and Sponsors Match Bot.


# Earn. Match bots. Authors.
**Authors match bot** monitors the publication of new posts by the specified authors and, after 5 minutes, votes for them if the Voting Power at that moment is not less than the specified one (upvote mana). This parameter is different for each author. The strength of the voice can range from + 0.1% to + 100% (max upvote). This bot does not vote for comments or re-blogs. Authors match bot has its own authorization. So far, the bot is limited to only positive votes. In order not to publish votes with a small value, it makes sense to estimate the weight of the vote and if it is less than 0.01 HBD (1 cent), then ignore it.
## How It Works (Simplified Version)
1. A user enables the Authors Match Bot authorization.
2. The user adds an author.
3. The author writes a post.
4. The user's like automatically appears on the post after 5 minutes.
## Authors Match Bot Page
**Title**: Authors Match Bot
**Switch**: This switch controls the authorization status of the bot. A red switch indicates that the bot is inactive, while a green switch indicates it is active.
**Description**: 
  - The Authors match bot automatically upvotes posts published by the specified authors. It does not upvote comments or re-blogs.
  - For each author, please specify the upvoting power in the range from +1% to +100% (maximum upvote). Actual value of the upvote depends on the current upvoting mana on the account at the time of the action.
  - Important: The Authors match bot only publishes upvotes with estimated combined value of 0.01 HBD or more. Votes will be processed as long as the mana (voting power) on the account remains above the threshold as specified for each author.
**Authorization Block**: 
  - The Authors match bot requires authorization to distribute votes on your behalf.
  - The authorization is completed via HiveSigner and can be revoked at any time.
  - **Disclaimer**: The service is provided on an "as-is" and "as-available" basis.
**Link**: "Authorize now" link for bot authorization. If the bot is active, this link changes to "Remove authorization."
**Add Author Button**: Click the "Add author" button to open a modal window for adding new authors.

# Earn. Match bots. Curators
**Curators match bot** repeats the curators' voices with a specified coefficient (from 1% to 10 000%). By default, the bot repeats only positive votes, but if the user specifies (ticks the check box), then downvotes are repeated with the same coefficient. In this case, the table uses the ± symbol in front of Vote ratio to indicate that negative votes are also repeated. For each curator, min Voting Power is set (upvote / downvote mana). If the estimated value of the vote is less than 0.01 HBD, then such a vote will not be played.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe9a7df2-3175-40c8-b8c3-594f619c812b)
## How It Works (Simplified Version)
1. A user enables the Curator Match Bot authorization.

- **Switch**: A toggle switch for activating or deactivating the bot. It appears red when inactive and green when active.

  - The Curators match bot automatically repeats the upvotes and downvotes of specified users (curators) on posts and comments. 
  - For each curator, please specify the voting ratio - the proportion of your vote to the curator's vote. For example, 100% means that you want the same vote as the curator. Sometimes, if your vote value is less than the curator's, you can amplify your vote. If you specified a 200% vote ratio and the curator voted 10%, your vote would be 20%. Please note that all votes are capped at a maximum of 100%.
  - Important: Important: If the estimated combined value of the vote is less than 0.01 HBD, the Curator match bot will skip this vote. If you also want to repeat curator’s downvotes, please check the corresponding box. Votes will be processed as long as the mana (voting power) on the account remains above the threshold specified for each curator.

- **Add**: A button labeled "Add curator" to add new curators. Clicking this button opens a modal window titled "Add new curator".
*Note: The "Authorize now" link will change to "Remove authorization" when the bot is active.*

# Earn. Match bots. Sponsors
**Sponsors match bot** - is an account for paying part of the reward for reviews in the form of votes, thereby reducing the amount of direct payment. If a user wants to become a Match bot, he needs to activate the toggle on the "Rewards" page in the "Sponsors" tab. For example the user has posted a review that is eligible to receive a direct reward of 5.00 WAIV. Match bot can upvote that post for a specified value of, say, 10% of the reward (assuming Match bot has enough voting value). This way, the user will receive 0.50 WAIV in author's rewards and the direct payment can be reduced to 4.50 WAIV. In order for the sponsor to add a match bot to the campaign. The Match bot should in turn add a sponsor. To do this, in the "Sponsors" tab, click on the "Add sponsor" button.

## How It Works (Simplified Version)
1. A user enables the Sponsor Match Bot authorization.
2. The user adds a sponsor.
3. The sponsor adds the user to the "Registered Upvoting Accounts" when creating the campaign.
4. When the campaign is completed, likes from the user are automatically added to the reviews.
## Sponsor Bot Page Information
- **General Information**: Provides details on how to manage the match bot, including examples of its use.
- **Switch**: Toggles the match bot on or off. Re-authorization through Hive and confirmation via HiveSigner are required when enabling or disabling the bot.
- **Active Switch**: The switch turns green when the match bot is active.
- **Inactive Switch**: The switch turns red when the match bot is inactive or deactivated.
- **Description**: 
  - Sponsors match bot is designed to offset portion of direct rewards with upvotes.
  - For example, the user has posted a review that is eligible to receive a direct reward of 5.00 WAIV. Match bot can upvote that post for a specified value of, say, 10% of the reward (assuming Match bot has enough voting value). This way, the user will receive 0.50 WAIV in author's rewards and the direct payment can be reduced to 4.50 WAIV.
  - Important: Third party campaign sponsors must register the match bot in their campaigns for the value of bot upvotes to be subtracted from the direct obligations.
- **Authorize Now / Remove Authorization**: "The match bot requires authorization to distribute votes on your behalf: Authorize Now / Remove Authorization". Functions the same as the switch for enabling or disabling the match bot.
- **Minimum Voting Power**: Indicates the minimum voting strength required for the match bot. "Minimum voting power:". Match bot will upvote eligible posts only if VP on the account exceeds the set value.
- **Change**: Link to open a modal window ("Change Minimum Voting Power Modal") where you can adjust the match bot's voting strength.
- **Disclaimer**: The Sponsors match bot service is provided on as-is / as-available basis.
