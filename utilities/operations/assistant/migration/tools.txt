# Tools / Site / Affiliate codes
The **Affiliate Codes** (website) page allows users to enter and manage their affiliate codes for the website. These codes enable users to earn commissions from affiliate programs such as Amazon, Walmart, and others by automatically integrating them into 'Buy Now' links across the site’s product listings.
![image](https://github.com/Waiviogit/waivio/assets/67378322/9a7154ec-897b-444c-a59b-05f26778330b)

### Element description in Affiliate codes (website) page
Title: Affiliate codes for {site}
Text: Enter your affiliate program codes from various platforms, including Amazon.com, Walmart.com, and others. These codes will be automatically integrated into the 'Buy Now' links across your website's product listings. This ensures you earn affiliate commissions from all sales initiated by your website visitors. Take advantage of the geo-targeting feature by entering affiliate codes for location-specific shops, such as Amazon.ca, Amazon.co.uk, and more. These codes will direct traffic based on the geographical location of your website visitors, thereby maximizing your potential affiliate revenues.
For a seamless and uninterrupted user experience, we also recommend checking and confirming the Product IDs on your products.
Find: "Find affiliate program"
Find field: search field by affiliate programs object type.
Codes title: "Affiliate codes:"
Codes list: list of affiliate programs that user added. Affiliate card include name, code and Delete button. If a user deletes an affiliate code and then re-adds the same code, our system will recognize this action. Instead of creating a new update, we will automatically validate and update the existing code, adding approve vote.

**Affiliate Code Features:**
- If a user has not provided a region-specific affiliate code, the system will default to the next available code in the country-region-global hierarchy. Button links for the missing region will redirect to the code that is set.
- If a user deletes a site, the corresponding affiliate code will be invalidated. However, if the user re-adds the same site with the same affiliate code, the system will automatically approve the code to make it active again.
- When an affiliate code is updated via the **Affiliate Codes** page (for both users and sites), it will automatically receive a 1% approval vote.
- If a user owns a store but hasn’t provided personal affiliate codes, the system will insert the website’s default affiliate codes on the **social.gifts** sites.


# Tools / Site / Administrators
Hive is a public blockchain where any user can publish updates to objects. These updates are then subject to community voting for approval or rejection. However, on individual websites, there may be a need for certain objects to appear in a specific way as defined by the site operators.
To manage this, the website owner can assign administrative privileges to certain Hive users, giving them the authority to govern the appearance and updates of objects. Administrators play a key role in deciding which updates to approve or reject.
![Administrator Management UI](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c453b00e-4c9c-43ad-8ff2-f6a11dd52f74)
### Administrator Voting and Object Ownership:
- **Voting Power**: Administrators have the final say in whether an update is accepted or rejected for the site. If several administrators vote on the same update, only the last vote is considered.
- **Object Ownership**: If an administrator claims ownership over an object, only the updates that are explicitly approved by that administrator (or other approved administrators) will be displayed for the object.
### Managing Administrators:
In **Administrators Mode**, the website owner can add or remove administrators as needed. The process for managing the administrator list is similar to managing a blacklist. 
1. **Grant Administrative Privileges**:
   - Use the "Find User" field to search for and select a Hive user to assign as an administrator.
   - The "Add" button will become active once a user is selected.
2. **List of Website Administrators**:
   - The **Administrator List** displays all users who have been assigned administrative privileges.
   - Each entry includes a delete button, allowing the removal of an administrator if necessary.


# Tools / Site / Moderators
Some content published on the Hive blockchain may conflict with local laws or company policies. To ensure that such content does not appear on your website, the site owner can appoint moderators.
![Moderator Management UI](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67378322/141975953-fb4f53c6-6c48-4c1b-87b8-8f541b02857b.png)
### Moderator Roles:
- **Hide Content**: If a moderator flags a post or comment as inappropriate, that content will be removed from the site.
- **Mute Users**: If a moderator mutes a user, none of the content from that user will be displayed on the site.
### Managing Moderators:
The process for managing moderators is similar to managing blacklists. 
1. **Grant Moderator Privileges**:
   - Use the "Find User" field to search for and select a Hive user to assign as a moderator.
   - The "Add" button will become active once a user is selected.
2. **List of Website Moderators**:
   - The **Website Moderators** section displays all users who have been granted moderator privileges.
   - Each entry includes a delete button, allowing the removal of a moderator if necessary.
Website Moderators Page Text: Some of the content on the Hive blockchain may violate local laws or company policies and it is essential that such content does not appear on the website. The website owner may grant moderator privileges to some Hive users. If a moderator flags a post or comment, that content will not appear on the website. If a moderator mute a user, none of that user's content will be displayed on the website.


# Tools / Site / Authorities
The **Authorities page** is a management interface where website owners can assign and oversee trusted users (authorities) who are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of object data on the site. It provides tools to:
- Add Hive users as **trusted authorities**, allowing them to approve or reject updates to specific objects.
- View and manage the list of authorities, ensuring that only approved updates from trusted users are displayed.
- Assign **ownership authority**, which limits object updates to those explicitly approved by the designated authority.
The page also allows site administrators to override authority votes, ensuring key decisions like affiliate link updates align with site goals.
Authority Roles:
- Claiming Authority: Any user can claim authority over an entity, enabling them to monitor and approve updates for accuracy.
- Trusted Authorities: The website owner can specify which authorities are trusted, ensuring that only updates approved by these users are applied to the site.
- Administrator Override: The votes of site administrators take precedence over authorities, allowing website operators to make key decisions like including affiliate codes on product links.
This mechanism can help ensure that object descriptions remain accurate while allowing controlled lists of objects to be added to the website.
For instance, a manufacturer can oversee the accuracy of their product descriptions, and a website can automatically add the manufacturer’s products to its catalog by including them in the trusted authority list.
Managing Authorities:
1. Add Authorities:
  - Use the "Find User" field to search for and add a user as a trusted authority.
  - The "Add" button will be enabled once a user is selected.
2. List of Trusted Authorities: Displays all users assigned as trusted authorities for the website. Each entry includes a delete button to remove a user from the list if needed.
Page main text: Any Hive user can declare that they are responsible for the accuracy of an object by claiming authority over it. They exercise their authority by approving or rejecting object updates. If full ownership authority has been claimed, then user assumes that only approved updates will be processed. The website owner can specify which authorities to trust (claims of other users will be ignored). This mechanism can be used to add controlled lists of objects to the website, while ensuring their accuracy.
![2021-11-16_13-27_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67378322/141977369-7b88e72a-85b5-4754-a91a-a7cd4eba2544.png)


# Tools / Site / Muted users
The **Muted Users page** is a management tool where website owners can monitor and control user privileges. It is divided into two tabs: **Muted** and **Blacklisted**, each serving a distinct function for user moderation.
Both tabs allow website owners to maintain control over user content and ensure that moderation aligns with site policies.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7aac475-fcbf-4bb8-8c94-0e5551e4719f)

### Muted Tab in Muted users
The **Muted** section displays a list of users who have been muted by website moderators or the site owner. Muted users' posts, comments, and profile information are hidden from the website. Website owners can mute users, but only the moderator who applied the mute can unmute them. If the site owner muted the user, they have the ability to unmute them.
Moderators can mute users and admins can add them to blacklists and even link to other users and their blacklists. In such a situation, it is important for the site owner to understand why the privileges of a particular user are suspended and by whom. In the case of blacklists, the site owner can restore the user's privileges to edit objects by adding him to his whitelist.
In the Muted section, all users who are muted by any moderator are collected in one list. The site owner can also mute users and on such users he sees the Unmute button. For everyone else - just a link to the moderator/ s who muted this user.
If the user is muted, then his posts and comments are not shown, and only his username is shown on the profile page. This mode can be used to partially satisfy the "right to be forgotten" when the user requires the site owner to keep information about him unavailable.
![Muted users page image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67378322/141988499-ac1f0d58-1420-4c08-bf73-523e75b643ce.png)
- **Features**:
  - Shows a list of all muted users, with a link to the moderator(s) responsible for muting each user.
  - Muted users only have their username displayed on their profile.
  - The list can be sorted by rank or recency of the mute action.
- **Text**: Website moderators can mute users. Posts, comments, and the profile content of muted users are not accessible on the website. The website owner can also mute users, but only the moderator who has muted a user can unmute them.

### Blacklisted Tab in Muted users
The **Blacklisted** section allows website administrators to blacklist users, which prevents any updates or votes from those users from being counted. Administrators can manage the blacklist and whitelist through the Rewards section, allowing for control over which users' contributions are ignored or restored.
![2021-11-16_14-32](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67378322/141988498-8b185bf1-17da-45cb-a388-9fea2338e480.png)
- **Features**:
  - Displays a list of blacklisted users, sourced from the Rewards section.
  - Administrators can override blacklists by adding users to a whitelist, restoring their privileges.
- **Text**: Website administrators can add users to blacklists. All object updates and votes on updates from blacklisted users are ignored. The website owner can also add users to their blacklist. They can also add users to their whitelist to override any other blacklist.
If the administrator added someone to the blacklist, then all updates initiated by this user and votes for updates are no longer counted. Only those updates remain for which there are other votes. In fact, all of this user's contribution to the creation and enhancement of objects should be ignored. Administrators do not have access to site configuration and they use a standard tool - (campaigns) blacklist.


# Tools / Site / AdSense ads
The **AdSense Advertisements** page is a user interface designed to help website owners integrate Google AdSense ads into their website. This ensures ads are displayed across all pages of the site, providing a consistent and seamless ad experience for visitors.
