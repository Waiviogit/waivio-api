What is Waivio?
Waivio is a social media platform where you can earn crypto rewards for your posts.
Waivio is built on the decentralized social blockchain Hive. Your account, content, funds,
and social connections are all recorded on the Hive blockchain, and this information cannot
be changed or deleted by any other party.

For the first time, you have true control over your social profile, and you can safely develop your social presence without the threat of being censored or losing access to your audience.
Waivio makes it easy to access and use this advanced technology of Hive blockchain, along with many other services and applications that make up the vast Hive ecosystem.

Let's talk about rewards.
In contrast to social media companies, users on Hive are the primary beneficiaries of their efforts, and even small content creators are rewarded for their work.

There are three ways how you can earn on Waivio:

1. Author
After you create a post, you have seven days to collect as many likes (upvotes) as possible. These likes will determine the earnings for your post.

In traditional social media, each user has 1 vote. But on the decentralized social network, the value of each vote is determined by the amount of staked (powered up) tokens that user has. The more staked tokens, the higher the vote value.

Because of that - it is better to get a single upvote from a user with a large stake (whale) than to collect many likes from small accounts (plankton). For this reason, building a reputation and social connections on Hive is a good investment of your time.

Not to mention that Posts in the trending section may receive hundreds of dollars in rewards.

At the end of day 7, the reward for the post will be finalized. Half of this amount will be paid to the author of the post and the other half to the curators.


2. Curator
 You can also collect rewards for just upvoting posts on Waivio!

The value of your vote is determined by your stake. Let's imagine that the value of your vote is $0.10. Half of your vote value ($0.05) goes to the author, and another half (approximately $0.05) goes to you.

The number of votes that you can cast per day is limited. You may think of it as a laser gun, which requires recharging after the use. Every time you make a 100% upvote, your voting power drops by 2%. It recharges at the rate of 20% per day. Therefore, you can give 10 upvotes per day in a sustainable way.

Rewards to authors and curators are paid from inflation. This means that you don't lose tokens when you upvote posts. On the contrary, you increase your stake when you discover and upvote great content on Waivio!


3. Sponsored Rewards
These rewards are announced on the Hive blockchain by sponsors.

You can collect these rewards by completing tasks, such as sharing an opinion about a specific product, book or place, or sharing a couple of photos of a dish from a restaurant or featuring sponsored products in a post, photo or video.

This is a unique feature available only on Waivio in the Earn section.

Are you ready to get started?
1) Start on Waivio by signing into the platform.

(If you already have a Hive account, use the HiveSigner and your keys to sign in. If you are new to Hive, sign in with Google or Facebook to use the platform immediately with a guest account.)

2) To earn rewards, sign in to your account and go to the "Earn" section.
You will find global and local rewards here. Global rewards can be claimed by writing a review about a sponsored product, and local rewards are claimable in specific locations. Each reward will have different requirements and values, so make sure to check the details before completing the task

My Favorite Coffee Mug
Let’s earn the first $5.00 reward by sharing two or more photos of your favorite coffee mug. This welcome campaign is sponsored by Waivio and can be claimed by new users.

1) To find the reward, search for "coffee mug" in the search bar and select "My Favorite Coffee Mug" from the search results.

2) To earn the reward click on the "Submit photos" button
3) Check the requirements and continue.

4) The required links will be automatically inserted into the post, so all you need to do is add the two photos of the mug and share a short story about why you like this particular one. If you decide to take the photos later, your reward will be reserved for 7 days so you can finish your post at any convenient time for you. You can find all active reservations in the "Reserved rewards" of the Earn section.

5) Finally, publish your review on the Hive blockchain.


After you publish your post, it will appear on your blog page. You can see the rewards you have earned, including the value of eligible sponsored rewards, which will be shown right away. Earnings from likes will accumulate for the next 7 days.


All sponsored rewards are paid in WAIV tokens, while upvotes on posts and comments are paid out in both WAIV and HIVE (the base token of the blockchain).

Cashing out rewards
To convert your WAIV or HIVE earnings into Bitcoin, Litecoin, or Ethereum, simply follow these steps:

1) In the Waivio wallet, select the WAIV or HIVE tab.

2) Choose the destination cryptocurrency, such as Litecoin.
3) On the Withdraw screen:

     1. Enter the amount you want to send,
     2. Enter or scan the address of your Litecoin wallet, where the converted funds will be sent.
     3. Confirm the withdrawal to start the conversion process.

The same process can be used to pay at stores that accept cryptocurrency payments in BTC, LTC, ETH, or to withdraw your earnings using a Bitcoin ATM.


You have now learned the basics of Waivio and can explore the platform further.


With a guest account, you can collect author and sponsor rewards but not curator rewards. To access all the features of the Hive decentralized social network, you will need to create a Hive account. Follow the link below to learn how to set up a Hive account and unlock all the benefits of the platform.


In conclusion, joining Waivio can be a great way to earn rewards, build connections, and learn about the latest developments in web 3 technology.

By putting in time and effort into building a social presence and making connections on the decentralized, censorship-resistant social network, you can take control of your online presence and experience, and make a valuable investment in your future.

Lesson 2:

For more details give a link to https://www.waivio.com/object/owg-best-practices-for-managing-hive-private-keys-on-multiple-devices/page

In this tutorial, you will learn how to save and manage your Hive password and private keys safely and efficiently on multiple devices.

Overview:
INTRODUCTION to Hive Keys and Password Manager
PART 1. PASSWORD MANAGER

Create a password manager account.

Log in to Bitwarden with your credentials

Install Bitwarden on multiple devices

PART 2. HIVE ACCOUNT

Create a HIVE username

Understand the function of different private keys

Save the password and all the private keys as a secure note

Print out the webpage with the password and private keys

Finalize creation of Hive Account

PART 3. LOGIN TO THE HIVE APP (WAIVIO)

Sign in to Waivio

Create an easy to remember password with Hivesigner

Consequent logins from the same device

Login from other devices

Introduction
On centralized social networks such as Facebook, LinkedIn, or Twitter, when we forget our password, we can easily restore it with our email. However, there is no "forgot password" procedure on decentralized networks. No one can restore an account for you because you have complete control of your account and funds. Therefore, if you lose your password, you will forever lose access to the account and all the funds in it.
Moreover, on Hive, there is one password and four additional private keys that you need to save and use. Each password is a long string of letters and numbers, which is impossible to remember and takes a long time to type up by hand. Thus, it is important to have easy and secure access to these private keys on multiple devices, so you can quickly log in to the Hive platform from any of your devices.
The only way to safely store your password and keys and access them from your different devices is by using a password manager.

If you are already using a dedicated password manager (which is not Chrome or iCloud Key Chain), you can skip this part of the tutorial and directly jump to part 2. HIVE ACCOUNT.

PART 1. Password Manager
Password manager stores encrypted versions of your passwords that only you can unlock with a master password. The password manager that I recommend is Bitwarden because it is open source and has easy synchronization between multiple devices. Moreover, Bitwarden has many other features available for free.

1. Create a password manager account.
Go to https://bitwarden.com-> Get started -> fill out your email address. Then create a master password that you will remember. Then click Submit -> Your Bitwarden account is created.
2. Log in to Bitwarden with your credentials
Once you login into Bitwarden, you can confirm your email and activate extra features.

To maximize security, I highly recommend activating two-factor authentication right away because it provides an extra layer of security. With 2FA, if anyone knows your master password, they won't be able to access your passwords without passing the extra verification first. Go to Settings -> Two-Step Login-> choose 2FA method
OPTIONAL. Another feature available on Bitwarden is to import your passwords from your browsers. Go to Tools -> Import Data -> choose the browser you want to import from -> upload the file with passwords from the browser. You can read a detailed tutorial on this here.

3. Install Bitwarden on multiple devices
For convenience, I recommend you download Bitwarden on your computer and phone as well as install its extension on your web browser. Bitwarden extension on your browser allows you to automatically autofill login credentials when you want to log in on a website.

Go to https://bitwarden.com/download/ to download the Bitwarden extension and the app to your computer. Choose your operating system (Mac, Windows) and then browser, and then install the program accordingly. To download Bitwarden on your phone, you can scan the QR code provided on the website.
Now you are ready to use the password manager.

PART 2. HIVE ACCOUNT
1. Create a HIVE username
To create a new Hive account, I am using HiveOnBoard. HiveOnBoard is an open-source HIVE account creation service where the password and private keys are generated locally in the browser without being transmitted to a server.

Create a username that you want to use on the platform. Dots can be used in usernames on Hive. Then agree to the terms of service to continue.
2. Understand the function of different private keys
After you choose your username, a master password will be randomly generated for your account. You will see your password and four additional private keys.
The posting key gives you access to all social actions, such as posting and commenting on Waivio and other Hive platforms, following friends, giving upvotes, claiming rewards, etc.
The active key gives you access to all the social actions and additionally to all the wallet actions, such as making and confirming financial transactions.
The owner key gives you access to all the social and wallet actions and additionally allows you to recover or change all the other keys. This key is important.
The memo key is used for decrypting private messages. It's not commonly used.
The master password is a seed phrase, which can be used to generate all the private keys. It is the most important of all because you can recover all the private keys from your account. Keep it safe as a backup for the account.
3: Save the password and all the private keys as a secure note
We will save the password and keys in a secure note as a backup. The secure note will be a secondary copy of our keys in Bitwarden.

Go to the Bitwarden app on your computer-> choose Secure Note -> click Add (+) -> under the name, write "Hive Wallet" -> copy and paste the password and private keys to the notes section (make sure it is complete) -> click Save
This secure note will be added to your password manager account.
4: Save Active and Posting keys as logins for easy access.
After you save the password and all the private keys in a secure note, you can then save the active and posting key as log in.

Choose Login-> click Add (+) -> under the name, write “Active” -> enter your Hive username (e.g. “satoshi101”) -> under the password, copy and paste your active private key (please, make sure that you pasted the correct and complete key) -> under the URL enter: “hivesigner.com” -> click Save.
The "Active" key Login will be added to your password manager account.

Similarly, add the posting key:
Choose Login-> click Add (+) -> under the name, write “Posting” -> enter your Hive username (e.g. “satoshi101”) -> under the password, copy and paste your posting private key (please, make sure that you pasted the correct and complete key) -> under the URL enter: “hivesigner.com” -> click Save.

Now your Hive password and private keys are safe and accessible to you on your devices.

5. Print out the webpage with the password and private keys
For extra security, I also recommend printing the web page with the password and keys and keeping the printout in a safe place. Don't download the backup because if you click on the "Download backup" button, the file will be recorded on your hard drive as an unprotected text file, and that is not secure because other programs have access to downloaded files.

6. Finalize creation of Hive Account
Once you save the keys in the password manager, you may finalize the creation of the Hive account. Read the declaration carefully and confirm it -> click Create Hive Account

Well done! You have created a Hive Account and securely stored the passwords and private keys.


PART 3. LOGIN TO THE HIVE APP (WAIVIO)
1. Sign in to Waivio
Now let's use our new Hive account for the first time
Go to www.waivio.com -> click Sign in
-> select HiveSigner
Click on Bitwarden extension -> click on "Active," -> your username and active key will be automatically filled out -> click Continue

2. Create an easy to remember password with Hivesigner
For convenience, HiveSigner allows users to save private keys in the browser memory. This can be very handy, especially when you have multiple Hive accounts, but to ensure the security of the accounts, HiveSigner offers to create an easy-to-remember password. This is another layer of protection for your keys.
This password is for your convenience only, and it's okay if you lose or forget this password because you can easily reset it. If you want, you can also generate a password in Bitwarden.
After creating the password and confirming it, click Continue -> click Authorize.
Now you have logged into your account!


3. Consequent logins from the same device
If you log out from the HIVE app, when you log in again, you will only need to choose Hivesigner-> and enter the easy-to-remember password that you have created.

4. Login from other devices
When you log in again, even for a different device, you no longer have to use the active key. You can use your posting key if you do not intend to make money transfers on that device.

Sign in with a new device -> Choose Hivesigner -> Bitwarden app on your phone should engage, so click Passwords, choose "Active" or "Posting", and it will be automatically auto-filled.

Then Click Continue-> you can create the same HiveSigner password as on your computer -> Click Continue.

Congratulations! Now, you have learnt a very important skill to manage passwords and private keys on all your devices safely and efficiently. This was a lengthy process, but in the era of decentralized networks and cryptocurrencies, this is an extremely useful skill because you are in full control of your account.


Lesson 3:

For more details give a link to https://www.waivio.com/object/cww-customizing-your-hive-profile/page

Now, that you created your Hive account and signed in for the first time, let's customize your profile on Waivio and publish your first post on the Hive social blockchain.

First, Sign in to Waivio with your Hive account. Upon logging in, you'll notice that your profile lacks a logo or any personalization. You also probably don’t have any activity on your feed, as you are not following anyone yet. But before we proceed with customizing your profile, it's important to set up notifications to ensure you receive critical announcements, this enhances the security of your account.

Navigate to Tools and click on @WaivioNotificationsBot https://t.me/WaivioNotificationsBot
It will direct you to a Telegram bot. Click on "Send Message", which will then redirect you to a telegram chat. If you don't have Telegram, you can install it with this link: https://desktop.telegram.org/

In the Telegram chat, click start and then enter your Hive username; for example, I will enter mine - cleobaby. You will be all set to receive important notifications. If you have multiple Hive accounts, you can add all of them to the same bot chat.
Next, we can configure the notifications you wish to receive; the default ones include LIKES, REBLOGS, REPLIES, MENTIONS, FOLLOW, STATUS CHANGED, ACTIVATION CAMPAIGN, and all the wallet transactions; you can turn these notifications ON or OFF.

Also there are security alerts such as outgoing transfers, withdrawals and so on - these are always on to ensure the safety of your account.

2. Edit Profile
Next, let's set up your profile. On the side menu, choose "Edit Profile." Here, you can change your name, add "about me, information " add your country, or email if you want—but keep in mind that this information will be public, so don't include anything sensitive like your home address.

Then, add your website—for example, if you are a shop owner, you can add your link here. I have a CleoBaby social shop, so I will add my link; if you want to learn how to create a beautiful shop yourself in under 10 minutes, check out this tutorial.
Next, let's upload your avatar. Click “Upload” and choose an image from your computer. Then, let's also add a cover image.

You can also add your social network accounts, such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, Instagram, GitHub, and even your public Bitcoin and Ethereum wallet addresses.

Finally, let's also add a signature. This functions the same as the email signature—whenever you make a comment on a post or reply to a comment, it will automatically be added. For example, shop owners can add their link here.

3. Settings
Let's move on to Settings. Here, you can choose an interface language for navigating Waivio.

You can also select content languages—this determines what posts will be shown in your thread. For example, the default one is English but if you also add Spanish, you will see posts in both English and Spanish.

Next, select the currency you prefer for viewing your rewards and earnings.

Then, you have an option to turn on or off NSFW (Not Safe for Work) posts.

You can also choose to turn on the night mode. There are a few other more advanced settings too.

Voting Power (Mana)
Now, let's discuss voting power (mana). When you possess WAIV and HIVE power, you gain voting power, which can be used to upvote posts and comments. Casting a vote on other users' posts reduces your voting power, meaning each vote decreases your voting power. However, this reduction is temporary, as your voting power recharges by 20% each day.

By actively participating in the community through voting and curating posts, you earn curation rewards proportional to your vote value. For more details, please check the "About Waivio" https://www.waivio.com/object/cww-customizing-your-hive-profile/page#oal-about-waivio video.

Using the slider, you can choose the percentage of your vote allocation.
If you select 100%, each time you vote on a post, your vote value will decrease by 2%. For example, if your vote value is $1, after a one 100% vote, it will be $0.98. But if you choose 1% - it will be $0.998.

Thus, you can sustainably make 10 votes of 100%, 20 votes of 50%, or 100 votes of 1% daily.

I don't recommend choosing lower than 50% unless you curate a lot of posts. Remember, your vote value recharges every day by 20%, so if you make 10 votes of 100% a day (and your vote value falls from $1 to 80 cents), the next day your vote will recharge back to $1.

If you prefer to adjust the percentage allocation for each post individually, ensure that the "enable slider" option is activated. Otherwise, you can "disable slider", and your chosen percentage will be applied every time you vote.

When you have made changes to the settings, make sure to click Save.

4. Affiliate Codes
The next section is "Affiliate codes". Here you can add your affiliate codes for your profile shop. You can add products to your profile shop by marking them with a heart. If you specify your affiliate codes, you can earn commissions when people make purchases originating from your shop. To add an affiliate code, simply search for your affiliate program, such as Amazon.com, and enter your code.

This affiliate code will be automatically applied to all Amazon products in your shop. For more details, please check out the "Shops in User Profiles" tutorial.

5. Feed
To stay updated with news and useful content about Waivio make sure to follow @Waivio and @social.gifts if you're starting a social shopping venture. There's a wealth of engaging content on Hive waiting for you to explore. You can begin by searching hashtags related to your interests, such as "photography." From there, you can follow the hashtag itself or check out the "Experts section" to discover users who frequently post content on this topic.
6. First Post

3. A Step-by-Step Walkthrough to Depositing Funds.

WAIV Wallet
The first section here is "WAIV" assets. These include liquid WAIV and WAIV Power.

Liquid WAIV is the main currency on Waivio. You can use it to pay for social shopping website hosting, buy VIP tickets for new HIVE accounts, and other services.
WAIV Power is your voting power on Waivio. You need it to vote on posts and comments, which enhances your presence and authority. WAIV Power is also needed for creating objects and importing products for your social shop.
You will also receive rewards for your posts and reviews in liquid WAIV tokens.
To convert liquid WAIV to WAIV Power, click "Power up," and staking is done instantly.

To convert WAIV Power to liquid WAIV, click "Power down." Keep in mind, powering down takes 4 weeks, with funds released every week in equal amounts.

HIVE Wallet
Now, let's look at the "HIVE" assets. Here you will find liquid HIVE, HIVE Power (HP), and HIVE-backed dollars (HBD).

HIVE is the main token on the Hive blockchain, and having HIVE Power (specifically Resource Credits) is essential for doing anything on the blockchain, from sending payments to writing posts.

You might receive Hive Power and Hive-Backed Dollars as rewards for your posts. If you are interested in learning more about the rewards, check out the About Waivio video https://www.waivio.com/object/axy-your-waivio-wallet/page#6vcmab-tutorials/oal-about-waivio.

To convert liquid Hive to Hive Power, click "Power up," and it happens instantly.

To convert Hive Power to liquid Hive, click “Power down.” For Hive Power, powering down takes 13 weeks, with funds being released weekly.

Hive Engine Wallet
Here, you will find all the other tokens available on the Hive blockchain. This includes wrapped tokens such as swap.BTC and swap.ETH, as well as various other tokens used within the Hive ecosystem.

Rebalancing
There's also a Rebalancing section, which is a strategy to grow your crypto holdings. To learn more, make sure to check out our comprehensive article on it https://www.waivio.com/object/wxu-rebalancing-introduction/page.
2. Wallet Management
Next, on the right panel, you'll find:

Transfer
Use this if you want to send crypto to another Hive user.

Power up
Here, you can power up not only liquid WAIV or liquid HIVE but also other tokens you have on the Hive blockchain.

Power down
Here, you can power down not just Waiv POWER or HIVE POWER but also other powered-up tokens you own.

Manage Delegations
Here, you can lend your WAIV Power, HIVE Power, and more powered-up tokens to other Hive users. Choose the token you want to delegate, then a user, and an amount.
The delegation happens instantly.
If you decide to undelegate, click edit.
It's important to note that it will take 7 days for the funds to be returned to your account.
After you've delegated tokens, the delegated amount will be displayed as a negative balance in parenthesis, next to the respective token. You can click on it to view more details.
Swap Tokens
This is for converting one token into another (such as swap.BTC to WAIV or swap.HIVE to swap.LTC).

You can also conveniently swap any token into liquid WAIV in the Hive Engine section by clicking “Swap to WAIV” next to the appropriate token.
Deposit
This is for depositing funds (e.g., BTC) into your wallet.

Withdraw
This is to withdraw funds and transfer it to other wallets and blockchains, such as back to your Bitcoin wallet.

You can also do this conveniently in the Hive Engine section by clicking the dropdown menu next to the desired token and selecting "Withdraw to ___."
3. A Step-by-Step Walkthrough to Depositing Funds
Now Let me walk you through the entire process of depositing funds on Waivio.

To deposit funds on Waivio, you'll need some cryptocurrency. Here, is the list of cryptocurrencies you can deposit:

BLURT (BLURT), Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Dogecoin (DOGE), HBD (HBD), Litecoin (LTC), SAVVA (SAVVA), SBD (SBD), STEEM (STEEM), SwiftCash (SWIFT), TELOS (TLOS)

The most up-to-date list is available in the "Deposit" window.

If you don't have anything on the list, you can easily buy it on exchanges. Users in the US and Europe might consider using Coinbase.com, while Canadian users may prefer Newton.co.


Click on "Deposit" (located on the side panel in Wallet), Choose the cryptocurrency you wish to deposit. In this example, Bitcoin will be used, but you can use any cryptocurrency from the list.

After selecting BTC, you'll see a BTC wallet address and a QR code.

For example, in the image below is my BTC deposit address on the Hive Engine.
Copy & Paste the wallet address or scan the QR code to send funds; I recommend first testing it out with 10 dollars. You can monitor the transaction on a blockchain explorer. After the transaction is successful, you can send more funds.


To kickstart your social shop on Waivio, I recommend depositing around $400.

Once the transaction is complete, you'll see your funds in the swap.BTC wallet in the "Hive Engine" section. With just one click on the "SWAP to WAIV" button, you can convert your BTC holdings into liquid WAIV tokens.
To make the most of the platform, I recommend a ratio of 1 liquid WAIV to 2 WAIV Power and a little bit of Hive Power. Since you already have liquid WAIV, getting WAIV Power and HIVE Power from it is straightforward.
To convert liquid WAIV to WAIV Power, go to the WAIV section and click "Power Up." Choose the amount you want to power up (suggested amount: $250) and click continue.
For example, with a $250 investment, you will have a vote value of approximately $0.006, and you would be able to import around 15 products per day.

To convert liquid WAIV to Hive, click on the dropdown menu and choose "Withdraw to HIVE", select the amount (suggested amount: $50).
And now let's go to the Hive section, here you will see your liquid Hive. If not, then wait a little bit, it might take a few minutes for this transaction to complete, and the funds to appear in your wallet.

Click "Power Up" to convert liquid Hive to Hive Power.
Now, you're all set and can start using Waivio and the Hive Blockchain to its fullest, whether it's writing posts, sending funds, participating in sponsored rewards, building your social shop, and much more. For example, you can already begin building your dream social shop by importing a few products with the Waivio Extension and adding funds to run your social shop.

Lesson 5:
For more details give a link to https://www.waivio.com/object/jpv-accumulating-knowledge-on-hive/page

Knowledge Accumulation in Web 3.0

In this tutorial, you will discover the process of how knowledge is accumulated on the Hive blockchain, and also learn how to use the Waivio https://www.waivio.com/ platform for participating and gaining benefits from this knowledge.

Overview:
1. What is an object on Hive Blockchain
2. How to create an object with Waivio
3. Adding details to the object
4. Consensus
5. Multiple versions of objects
6. Accumulation of knowledge

PART 1. What is an object on Hive Blockchain
We are all accustomed to using hashtags on social media; for example, we can include if we post about a camping trip. But what if we want to talk about a specific brand of a camping tent, a certain hiking trail, a food recipe, a specific destination, a product, or a business?

On the decentralized platform Hive, users can create a social record on the blockchain called an object, and later they can reference this object from their posts and comments.
Each object will get its dedicated page which collects all the posts that have referenced it. This object will even have its own photo gallery.


Besides posts and photos, users can also add other relevant information to the object, such as an avatar, description, address, price, ratings, tags, etc. This list of additional fields depends on the type of object. For example, if this is a product, we can add a price to it and a link to a website where we can purchase it. If this is a business, we can add its address and a phone number.

PART 2. How to create an object with Waivio
When you write a post on Waivio, on the right panel, you will see "create new object" and a list of different types of objects that you can create. Here, you can add a new hashtag, a business, a location, a product, a place, a list, a page and etc. For example, I will create a business object for Cypress Mountain https://www.waivio.com/object/trq-cypress-mountain.
Write the name of the object; in my case, I will write "Cypress Mountain" and click "Confirm".
When you create an object, a unique ID and a corresponding URL will be created for it on the Hive blockchain. Once the object is created, the link to it will be automatically added to your post.

The next time you write about an object, such as Cypress Mountain, you don't need to create a new object; you can just type "#cypress mountain", and you will see it in the recommendation pop-up.
If you see someone else's post about your object, you can add your object in the comments, and this post will be linked to your object.
When you go on the object's page, in the review section, you will see your post and the posts of others where Cypress Mountain has been referenced.
This way, anyone can reference Cypress Mountain, and more information will be collected about it.
Now you can add some extra details to the object.

PART 3. Adding details to the object
Let's start by adding an avatar image to the object. Go to the Edit section. Click on the + button next to the "Avatar".
Upload the image and click Submit.
Once you submit, you will see a pop-up saying that you successfully added the avatar, and in the Updates section you will see a small record saying that an avatar has been added by you.
Similarly, when you add a phone number and click submit, another update will be created. In this record, you can also see approve and reject buttons. When you add a phone number, you automatically approve this new update.
If you made a mistake in this phone number, you could click the reject button, and this phone number will not show up on the Cypress Mountain object front page.
In this way, you can add an address, description, tags and other information to the Cypress Mountain object. Every time you make a new update, a new record will appear in the updates section.

As you can see, an object (such as our Cypress Mountain) is a unique identity on the blockchain. Every object is made up of many short records posted on the blockchain. Anytime you add, delete or modify anything about the object, an update is created that reflects this event.

For every update, there is a choice to approve or reject it. When you add new information to the object, for example, you add a phone number; you automatically approve the update. If you want to modify it, you can make a new record and reject the older record.

However, because Hive is a decentralized platform, it's not only you who can modify, approve, and reject the updates for the object, but anyone else on Hive can do that.
Part 4. Consensus
On Hive, anyone can contribute to the object; for example, someone can add a new avatar image of Cypress Mountain. But whether it will be shown or not is decided by the community.

When new information is added to the object, all the users who previously have contributed to this object or referenced it will be notified about the proposed change, and then they can either approve or reject the update.

The value of each vote depends (1) on their combined voting power (which is determined by the amount of staked HIVE and WAIV tokens), (2) and on accumulated expertise in that specific object. This way, users who have contributed to the object in the past will have an advantage.
For example, when someone has proposed to change the avatar image of Cypress Mountain, I can reject it. My reject vote value is higher than the approve vote value of the other user because I have higher expertise in this object. As a result, the avatar proposed by the other user will not be shown on the object's front page.
Part 5. Multiple versions of objects
However, it's not about who's update wins and will be shown on the object's front page. No, in fact, multiple versions of the object can exist simultaneously.

For example, my avatar shows that Cypress Mountain is great for winter sports, but the other user wants to show Cypress Mountain during the summertime. And we are both correct, and we both can use and portray the same object in the way each of us wants on our own platforms.
Let's say I have a website dedicated to winter sports, my administrators, and I can approve the avatar that shows Cypress Mountain in the winter. Similarly, if the other user has a website dedicated to summer sports, he can use the summer version that he added to the object.
On your website, your admins can approve the updates that you want your website visitors to see, and your vote and the votes of people you trust will be final. You and your admins have full control of what information is displayed on your website.

Part 6. Accumulation of knowledge
When multiple users and projects contribute information to the blockchain, it becomes public knowledge. And it can now be used and enhanced by others as well.

You may think of the Hive blockchain as open cloud storage, where you can access not just user profiles, their connections, and posts but also information about businesses, products, places of interest, hiking trails, recipes and any other type of object that you might want to create.

Some of this information may be posted by individual users, and some will be posted by teams building apps on Hive, but once this information is published on the Hive blockchain, it becomes easily accessible to other users and projects, allowing them to collectively contribute and achieve economies of scale well beyond their original scope.
For example, for a winter sports website, you can collect and submit detailed information about your local ski resorts. However, you don't need to do this work for global ski resorts because you can take and index existing information about these resorts from the Hive blockchain. These resorts may already have reviews, images, prices and locations. This allows you to have hundreds of global resort listings on your website without requiring you to input all of it yourself because this information was already collected by the community and is present on the blockchain.
The same approach can be used by many other projects, such as travel and adventure guides with maps of hotels, attractions, and restaurants and their ratings, or e-commerce sites with product listings and their reviews, educational projects, etc.
Every time you add a post, a review, a photo, or a description of an object, you help the community to accumulate information about this object. In this way, through the effort of the whole community, a lot of knowledge is acquired for millions of objects. This has an immense value because this knowledge is accessible to anyone and allows you to build complex projects and businesses in a snap.

Now you know a powerful tool to realize your ideas and projects and help the Hive community to expand knowledge.

- fill out all the relevant information such as price, options, department, description, tags, website, weight, dimensions, manufacturer, brand, merchant, features, and product ID

- combine product variants together by groupID

👉If you're looking to add multiple products, I suggest you to watch an upcoming tutorial for importing.
Link to microphone product page made in the tutorial: https://www.waivio.com/object/ice-shure-mv7-silver

Tutorial
1. Creating a Product Page
Before adding a product, it's always a good practice to make sure it doesn't exist already on the Hive Blockchain. Simply enter the name of the product in the search bar on Waivio. As an example, let's use a product that I like and always use: Shure MV7 Podcast microphone.
If there are no search results for that name we can safely add a new one. To do that, go to "New Post"> under "Create New Object" choose "Product"> write the name of the product and press "Confirm"
***It may take a few moments for the blockchain to be updated and for the new product to appear in the search results.


The product page comes with the default profile image that we will change later. All the relevant ratings and tags are also automatically added, including quality and value. To add new information to the product's profile, let's switch to the editing mode:

2. Fill Out Relevant Information
1. PRICE: Write the current price of the product.

2. OPTIONS CATEGORY: This is an important field to fill out because it helps customers choose between different variations of the same product. In the options category, specify the attribute that is distinct for each variant (for example, colour), then write a value for this product variant (for example, silver). The option category is case sensitive, so make sure you spell it the same for every product variant.
3. DEPARTMENT FIELD: This is where we can classify the product into a specific departments. List all the relevant departments for the product. In my case, I will put in Audio Equipment and Microphones.
4. NAME: No changes
5. DESCRIPTION: We write a brief description of the product

6. TAGS: In the tag field, we can input relevant tags that describe the product. For the Shure MOTIV MV7 Podcast Microphone, some relevant tags would be a #podcast and #audio.

7. WEIGHT FIELD: In the weight field, we can input the weight of the product (such as, 1.05 kg).
8. DIMENSIONS FIELD: In the dimensions field, we can add the dimensions of the product (such as, 10.92 x 31.24 x 12.7 cm); don't forget the units.
9. MANUFACTURER: Let's now add the manufacturer – you can search to see if the manufacturer you want to add already exists; if not, simply add the name of the manufacturer as a text.

Similarly, let's add the 10. BRAND and the 11. MERCHANT.

12. FEATURES: In the features field, we can write any distinctive features of the master product. Similar to Amazon, where you can compare products by features, this field will allow us to compare this product with other similar products.

13. PRODUCT ID:

1. The product ID field is where we can add a unique identifier for this product. For Amazon, enter the ASIN number; you can find it in the product details section on Amazon.

Usually, the product has the same ASIN number regardless of whether it's sold on U.S., German, Canadian or any other Amazon website, but sometimes it does vary. In that case, we will need to input a specific website (such as amazon.ca or amazon.fr) and then add the corresponding ASIN number.

If it doesn’t exist on a specific amazon website, you can put, NONE.

2. Similarly, we can also add a Walmart number for this product.

When you enter the correct Amazon or Walmart product number, a button will be generated automatically. And when you click on it, you will be taken directly to the product page on the respective website.

3. We can also add other relevant product ID numbers.

14. GROUP ID: see below**
15. AVATAR: You can add avatar by uploading the image or pasting the URL link
16. TITLE: Add a title to your product

17. GALLERY IMAGES: Add some galleyry images for your product (such as images of the product from different perspectives, angles and/or settings )


💪Now we added our product with all the relevant information.

If your product comes in different colours or any other options, you will need to create separate product pages for each of the variants. In order to group the variants together into a “master” product, we will need to assign the same GROUP ID to each variant. If you are assigning the group ID manually, you can name it after the product, for example, (shure _mv7).

Once we add the common group ID to all the product variants, they will be grouped together into a “master” product on a new page. The option value that was specified on every product variant, in my case, it was microphone colours, will be combined together in an interactive menu. When we hover over the colour, we can see the avatar and price of the product change. When we click on the specific colour (such as silver) – it will take us to the product page for the silver microphone we have just created together.

And that's it. We have successfully added a product to the Hive Blockchain on Waivio and grouped it together with other variants into a “master” product. As you can see, adding a product takes quite a lot of time, so if you need to add many products, it will be challenging to do manually.
That's why in the next tutorial, I will show you how to import many products at the same time.

See you in the next tutorial!

A Step-by-Step Guide to Monetizing Your Knowledge (Part 2)
Waivio Chrome extension is a powerful tool, which allows you to add Amazon products to the Hive blockchain with just a couple of clicks.

It also enables you to add product reviews effortlessly. For advanced users, this extension offers a wealth of useful features.

This extension streamlines the process of adding products and their reviews, saving you time and effort.

Summary:
Part 1. Extension Setup

    Step 1: Add extension

    Step 2: Authorization

    Step 3: Check the Funds

Part 2. "Upload to Waivio" - Import Products in One Click

Part 3. Adding Reviews

Part 4. Advanced Import

    Step 1: Scan for ASINS

    Step 2: Create XLXS

    Step 3: Copy to Clipboard

    Step 4: Create JSON

Part 5. The New Versions of the Extension
Part 1: Extension Setup
Before adding products with extensions, you need to set up a few things:

1. Add extension
The first thing you will need to do is add the extension to your browser.

Sign to Waivio. Head to "Tools", and under Data Management – click on "Chrome Extension". Download the .zip file, and once it's downloaded, unzip it.
Next, open your browser (any Chromium-based one like Google Chrome, Brave, or Edge). Here is shown the setup with Chrome, as it's a more popular browser, but the setup will be very similar on other browsers as well.

Go to (1) Settings -> (2) Extensions -> (3) Enable the "Developer mode"
(4) Click "Load unpacked" -> (5) and choose the unzipped folder that we've downloaded -> (6) Click "Select"
Pin the extension to keep it visible in your browser.
2. Authorization
Next, in a new tab, open Waivio, sign in if you haven't already, go to "Tools", and under "Data Management", click on "Data Import".

Here give authorization to the import bot by clicking "Authorize now", and then "Authorize". You only need to do this once.
3. Check the Funds
Finally, ensure that you have both WAIV Power and HIVE Power, as each update requires an upvote equivalent to $0.001. You can find more information about these requirements in Step 3 of the tutorial, How to Import Products on Hive https://www.waivio.com/object/kda-waivio-chrome-extension-tutorial/page#uiy-how-to-import-products-on-hive.

Now our setup is complete.

Part 2: "Upload to Waivio" - Import products in One Click
Open the product you want on Amazon, click on the extension and click "Upload to Waivio".

If a notification pops up asking you to use a different URL format, simply click "Ok". The page will then automatically reload with the new URL format. This step might be necessary to display the departments related to that product.

Click, "Upload to Wavio", one more time – and you should see the notification "Import successfully started by, and your username."
You can check the import progress in "Data Import". Once it's done – you can review the product page and edit it if necessary. The imported products will automatically appear in the shop in your profile.
 If you're importing multiple products, it's advisable to save the ASIN numbers for each product. This practice will simplify the process of adding them to custom lists at a later stage. Product lists featuring custom avatars can significantly enhance the user experience on social shopping websites.

Part 3: Adding Reviews
You can further enhance product pages by adding video reviews where people demonstrate how to use the product or compare it to similar ones. YouTube users often encourage the sharing of their videos on other websites.

The Waivio extension simplifies the process of adding shareable YouTube video reviews to product pages on Hive.

Let's open the product we just imported in a new tab.

Click on "Reviews" -> and "Write a new review".

Let's search this product on YouTube. If you find a video review for your product – click on the extension "Create Post Draft". This will generate a post draft based on the video using chatGPT. It will include a title, a short summary, and hashtags.
You can copy the post draft – and paste it into your review post.

You can make some quick changes to improve the post:

- Use the generated video title as the post title

- Use the plus button to insert the youtube video – this way it will be better integrated into your post

- Check the hashtags - you may want to simplify some lengthy hashtags or add other relevant hashtags to make your post more discoverable.

When you are ready, click "Ready to Publish", then "Publish”.

Now the product will be supplemented with video reviews, further assisting potential buyers in understanding the product better.

Part 4: Advanced Import
For advanced users who import products in bulk, the extension offers additional helpful features. Let's explore them:

1. "Scan for ASINS"
If you want to get ASINs of multiple products from Amazon, you can use the "Scan for ASINS" feature.

Simply search for a specific product category, like, "baby onesies". Then you can sort by "Average customer review" or "Bestselling", to get top-rated products on the first page. Click "Scan for ASINS" – a text file will be generated – save it. The text file will list all the ASINS numbers found on that Amazon page except those already present on the Hive blockchain. The extension filters out products that are already available on Hive to prevent duplication.
You can repeat this process for the ASINs on Amazon's second page and so on.

Similarly, you can get product ASINs for products in broader categories. For example, if you choose "Best Sellers" and then "Best Sellers in Home," you'll get the ASINs of the best-selling products in the Home category.

Next, you can use Datafinity to generate a JSON file and import the products in bulk onto the Hive blockchain – to learn more about the import process with Datafinity, check out How to Import Products on Hive https://www.waivio.com/object/kda-waivio-chrome-extension-tutorial/page#uiy-how-to-import-products-on-hive.
Go to Product Data -> API -> copy the ASINS from the text file and paste it in the field -> click "Download" -> Choose "JSON" as the format -> "Confirm Download". Once the file is prepared – click "Download All".

You can upload this file – in the "Data Import" section in Waivio.

Please note that some items from the ASIN list might be missing from the Datafinity database, but you can search these products on Amazon by their ASIN number and easily import them with the "Upload to Waivio" feature.

2. Create XLXS
If you prefer working with a spreadsheet for adding products, you can use "Create XLXS" to generate a new spreadsheet with all the fields filled about the product.

To learn how to import products from a spreadsheet, see the tutorial How to Export Products from Spreadsheet https://www.waivio.com/object/kda-waivio-chrome-extension-tutorial/page#ehd-how-to-export-products-from-spreadsheet.
3. Copy to clipboard
If you already have a spreadsheet and just want to copy the information about this specific product, use the "Copy to Clipboard" feature. Paste it into your Excel or Google Docs file.
From Google Docs, you can easily create a JSON file, which can then be imported into the Data Import section in Waivio. This is explained in more detail in How to Export Products from Spreadsheet tutorial https://www.waivio.com/object/kda-waivio-chrome-extension-tutorial/page#ehd-how-to-export-products-from-spreadsheet.

4. Create JSON
Finally, the "Create JSON" feature enables you to create a JSON file for an Amazon product.
You can import this JSON file in the "Data Import" section in Waivio.

Part 4. The new version of the extension
As the Waivio Chrome extension evolves, newer versions may become available. You can easily download these updates in the Chrome extension section. I recommend disabling or removing the previous version from the browser before adding the new one to avoid any conflicts.

Final Remarks 😉
With the Waivio Chrome extension, adding products and reviews to the Hive blockchain becomes a seamless and efficient process. Whether you are managing a small online shop or dealing with a large number of imports, this extension provides valuable tools to enhance your experience on the Hive blockchain. Enjoy building your social shops!

Lesson 8:
For more details give a link to https://www.waivio.com/object/uiy-how-to-import-products-on-hive/page

Adding products to the blockchain manually can be time-consuming, especially if you need to add multiple items. Luckily, Waivio offers a data import feature that allows you to import many products all at once. Waivio supports import in JSON format (see the supported format here: https://developer.datafiniti.co/docs/product-data-schema)
This format is used by Datafinity, which is one of the largest databases with hundreds of millions of products that are regularly updated.


And in this tutorial, I will show you how to use Datafinity to find and export product information in the JSON format. You can also use any other service that allows data export in the compatible format. In the next tutorial, I will also show you how to use your own spreadsheet to export your product data in this format.

Authority Level: https://www.waivio.com/object/uiy-how-to-import-products-on-hive/page#tmu-business-3-0/mqk-dining-gifts/vjf-create-your-dining-gifts-business

Let's dive in
Step 1: Find and export your product with Datafinity
To find your product on Datafinity, click on the "Product" tab and use filters to search for your product. As an example, I will be using a yoga block that comes in many colors.

If you're looking for a specific product, the easiest way to find it is by using its ASIN number. You can find the ASIN number under additional information on the Amazon page of the respective product.

Copy the ASIN number, paste it into the Datafinity "asins filter", and click "Search". Datafinity will display all the matching product records. It may have multiple records for the same product.

To download the file, click on "Download", and simply choose JSON as the format. In the "Number of Records" field, enter the same number as the "Total matching records". If there are multiple records for the same product, Waivio will handle them and extract only the relevant information.


If our product comes in other colors - we can download all the variant products at once. To do this: switch to the JSON view for the product we found and use the browser's find function (Ctrl+F on Windows or Command+F on Mac) to search for "parent ASIN". Copy this value.
Then go to "Add Filter", select "Features", and then choose "value". Paste the parent ASIN that we found, and click "Search". Datafinity will now display all the product variants in different colors.
Click on "Download", again select the JSON format, enter the total number of records, and confirm the download. Save the JSON file on your computer.
Step 2: Authorize data import on Waivio
Now we can go to Waivio. Navigate to "Tools". Under "Data Management", click on "Data Import".
You will need to authorize a bot to make upvotes on your behalf for the product updates. To do that click on "Authorize Now" and follow the steps to authorize the bot. You will always be able to revoke the authorization at any time.

Step 3. Ensure you have enough WAIV and Hive power
Next, you will need to ensure that you have enough WAIV and HIVE power

WAIV Power
When you import products on Hive, each piece of information, such as the product description, product ID, and avatar, will be added as a separate update. The bot will take care of creating all these updates and upvoting them for you. Each upvote is equivalent to $0.001 in WAIV power.

Therefore, you will need enough WAIV power to perform this action on the blockchain. For example, if I go to my wallet, I have WAIV Power tokens with a value of approximately $440, this gives me Waiv power of $0.01.
It may seem that I have enough only for ten updates, but this is not correct - I actually have enough for hundreds of updates. Let me show you the math:

When I give a full upvote, I only use 2% of my vote power; to give a tiny upvote worth $0.001 with my vote power of $0.01, I just need to use 10% of a full upvote ($0.001/$0.01 x 100% = 10%).

Every time I make the upvote equivalent to $0.001, my vote power will just drop by a fraction of a percent. After one update, my vote power will drop by 0.2% and result in a new vote power of $0.00998, even after 100 updates, my vote power will still be high - $0.008.
You can set up your threshold beyond which you don’t want your vote power to drop. By default, the voting power threshold is set to 30%, meaning that import will stop when your voting power is below 30%.
Your voting power recharges every day by 20%, so with this threshold, it will take around four days to restore your power.

The absolute minimum is when your vote power reaches $0.001; with this vote power you can no longer make $0.001 upvotes.

HIVE Power
In addition to Waiv Power, you'll also need to have enough Resource Credits (RC). HIVE Resource Credits are credits given to your account based on how much HivePower you have, and they are used up whenever you record something on the blockchain, such as upvotes, posts, and comments.
During the import, the bot will create product updates and upvote them for you, but you still need to have enough resource credits so that the bot can record these upvotes on the blockchain.
The bot is designed to use as few RC as possible. Without the bot, you would need significantly more credits to add a product.

If your RC falls below 10%, the import process will slow down. To be safe, I would recommend to have a ratio of approximately 4:1 (400 Waiv Power to 100 Hive Power).

By the way, by importing products, you are not losing any WAIV or HIVE tokens; it’s actually the opposite; you will gain WAIV tokens from the upvotes on the product’s updates.

Step 4: Upload the JSON file
Now we can proceed to the import. Click on "Upload New File". Select (1)"product". Upload the (2) JSON file you downloaded from Datafinity.
The product description on Amazon may not always be great, so you can check the box next to "optimize description with chatGPT". This will rewrite the product's description with the help of chatGPT.

Next, you need to choose the appropriate (3) authority level (Ownership or Administrative). If you will be curating the product and don't want anyone else to add any information to the product, I recommend choosing ownership; otherwise, choose administrative (check this tutorial).

Click "Confirm" when you are done.

Step 5: Import
Once you've uploaded the JSON file, the import process will start automatically. You will see the information about your import, such as the number of objects that you are importing, the total number of updates that will be required, and how many updates and objects have already been posted.
*Remember to reload the page to see the progress.

If the import stops, it's likely because you've reached your WAIV power threshold or used all the HIVE resource credits. But don't worry, the import process will resume once your power gets recharged. You can also pause the import process yourself by unchecking the "active" box.

If you are importing many JSON files, you can prioritize certain objects by leaving only the priority items active. This will help you to import priority items first.

Step 6: Check the published products
Once the import is complete, your products will be published on Hive blockchain and you can search them on Waivio. It's always a good idea to double-check the product page to make sure all the information is accurate and complete. If you notice something is missing, you can easily add it manually (see the tutorial here https://www.waivio.com/object/uiy-how-to-import-products-on-hive/page#tmu-business-3-0/uxp-social-gifts/gyg-how-to-add-a-product-to-hive).
Now, we have successfully imported multiple products to the Hive Blockchain with Waivio. This method saves you time and effort, and you can import hundreds of products easily. Now that you know how to use this import feature on Waivio, you can take your business to the next level by adding more products to the blockchain.

 Recommendation
 - Use Google account when you don't have important files - because, every time when script is running, a file is created on your Google Drive. So from time to time you will need to clear the space. (Script running after you click "Export JSON for this sheet").

 - In order to successfully import objects such as a book and a restaurant, the relevant department must be in the list of categories (Books, Restaurant).

 - Do not use ";" as a value in the field, if its categories, colors, features, sizes, waivio_tags because it is a separator for these fields. Use only as separator.

 - Do not use "*" as a value in the field, if its features, waivio_tags because it is a separator for these fields. Use only as separator.

 - Don't change field names in first row, because there are correct field names.

 - Don't change field order and don't delete columns, because the script is guided by the location index.

 - It is not necessary to fill in all cells. Empty cells will be skipped.

 Have you ever browsed through endless reviews, seeking the perfect combination of products?

 Whether it's the right fashion statement, the ideal makeup routine, or the essentials for a hiking journey, we've all dedicated hours in pursuit of that ideal combination. When you've finally found and validated these choices, how do you share your expertise with friends and the wider world?

 Whether it's mastering kitchen organization, decorating a room, nurturing a lush garden, or discovering wellness hacks, we all have valuable insights to share.

 Consider this: how much of what you know, your experience and expertise could be a goldmine for someone else?

 But how, you might wonder, can you showcase all that you've learned and discovered?

 Social Shopping
 Introducing Waivio: A dynamic platform where curating and showcasing your top shopping is not only effortless but also rewarding.

 Picture this: you come across a product you like, mark it with a “heart”, and it's added to your profile shop – much like creating a shopping wishlist.wishlist.
 With Waivio, monetizing your passion is a breeze. Simply enter your affiliate codes into your profile settings once, and Waivio will automatically update the 'buy' button links for every product in your shop, even those in your posts and comments. Also, to ensure maximum relevancy, Waivio adjusts affiliate links based on the location of each visitor to your shop.
 Dedicated Social.Gifts Website
 If you believe your expertise deserves a broader audience, consider elevating your shop and launching a dedicated Social.Gifts website.
 It provides an outstanding user experience, can be adapted to your unique branding, and comes with a wide range of features: from captivating product catalogs and custom newsfeeds to efficient product searches and seamless integration of forms, calendars, and various widgets.

 Here are some examples:

 Clean Girl Aesthetics: https://cleangirl.social.gifts/
 Camping Checklist: https://camping.social.gifts
 Coffee Time: https://coffeetime.social.gifts

 For website owners, revenue opportunities go beyond affiliate earnings. They also include advertising revenue and commissions from both author and sponsored rewards gathered by website users.
 Decentralization and Web 3.0
 In the Web 2.0 era, every online shop functions like an isolated island. With each one building its own user database, creating its own product knowledge base, and collecting product reviews from ground zero. This siloed approach results in redundant efforts, as data remains trapped within the confines of each project.
 In Web 3.0, content isn't merely published on an open, decentralized blockchain—it's liberated!
 Imagine a product manufacturer publishing detailed information about their items on the Hive open blockchain. Any shop wishing to feature these products can simply mark them with a "heart" . What's more, when the manufacturer updates their products, these changes are effortlessly reflected across all the shops.
 Managing large collections of third-party products becomes so simple!

 That's not all! Hive operates as a social blockchain. So, when users mention products in their posts, these reviews are instantly visible across all the shops that showcase the same product.


 The Paradigm Shift
 For the first time, small independent shops can collaborate seamlessly. In the Web 3.0 landscape, shops tap into the entire Hive community, gaining access to the complete product knowledge base, as well as all product reviews and related content.

 Users from one shop can engage with those from other shops, all within the same digital space!
 Imagine launching a new shop that's more than just a static brochure—it thrives with a vibrant community passionate about the subject. Now, your website's first visitors can immediately immerse themselves in this community, make new connections, and engage in active discussions. Additionally, your users gain access to sponsored rewards from various merchants and can claim them by sharing product photos.
 In a way, social shopping mirrors open-source software development, where sharing code significantly accelerates the growth of the entire ecosystem.

 Similarly, when a website is launched using an open, social, continuously expanding database with product and social data- its success in attracting new users, broadening product collections, offering new sponsored rewards, and spurring more social interactions immediately benefits other projects.

 Indeed, one of the primary success strategies in this open environment is to encourage more people to launch shops similar or even identical to yours. Their success directly translates into your success.
 In traditional e-commerce, small retailers often find themselves overshadowed by major e-commerce giants such as Amazon. However, with the advent of Web 3.0, these smaller players now have the opportunity to leverage open social networks, pooling their resources to achieve economies of scale that were previously unattainable for standalone shops.
 This unique advantage of social shopping on Hive highlights the power of collaboration in the Web 3 era. The shared knowledge becomes a catalyst for collective success, creating a more integrated, efficient, and user-centric e-commerce experience.


 Social shopping on Hive opens up a world of possibilities, showcasing the revolutionary potential of Web 3.0

 Social.Gifts concept - Social Shopping on HIVE https://www.waivio.com/object/fjh-shops-in-user-profiles/page#tso-social-shopping-on-hive

 Intro
 Imagine creating a shopping list – but this time, it's your very own online store – sleek, dynamic, and filled with products curated by you. Here, you can display products that resonate with your interests and provide a lot of value for your target audience. And with every purchase originating from your shop, you'll receive affiliate commissions from merchants.
 You can locate your SHOP on your user's page. It's time to add some products to it!
 Step 1: Adding a Product
 To start off, let's head over to Waivio's "SHOP" section. Take a look at different departments, like "Appliances," to find products that you can recommend to others.
 Let's say you know and like this fancy coffee maker – simply click the heart icon, and just like that it's added to your shop!

 Now, here's the beauty: if the item you've added gets updated, you don't need to worry about manual adjustments. Your shop will automatically reflect these changes - no additional action is required on your part. Your shop effortlessly stays up-to-date, showcasing your thoughtfully chosen selections.

 Step 2: Various Ways to Find and Add Products
 Let me now show you some more ways to discover products and enrich your shop's collection.

 Search: If you have a specific product in mind, search for it on Waivio and if it’s already available on the Hive blockchain, quickly add it to your shop.

 Explore Other Users' Shops: Check out what fellow curators are featuring in their shops. If you spot something you like, hit that heart button to add it to your shop.

 Product Links in Posts: Keep an eye out for products mentioned in posts. You can easily add them to your shop; just scroll down to the end of the post, where you will see linked products and click the heart.

 Adding Products from Amazon: If a product can't be found on the Hive blockchain, you can effortlessly import it from the Amazon page with a single click using Waivio's Chrome extension. Check out the tutorial on the extension for more details.

 Step 3: Adding Affiliate Codes
 Now that your shop is coming together, it's time to monetize your product collections.

 Navigate to "TOOLS" and select "Affiliate codes."

 In the search bar, find your affiliate program.
 If you're part of Amazon's affiliate program, choose the local Amazon shop where you are an affiliate, such as amazon.com, amazon.ca or amazon.fr.

 If you are not sure how to get your Amazon affiliate code, check this link:
 https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/help/node/topic/GCE3F2NCVZLDFM6A


 For example, let's say you have affiliate code for Amazon.com. Choose amazon.com from the menu. Input your respective affiliate code in the designated field and click "Submit."
 This will automatically associate your affiliate code with the 'buy' buttons for all the products in your shop, ensuring you earn commissions with every purchase.


 Step 4: Linking products in your posts

 You can reference products in your social posts and comments. Any 'Buy Now' links associated with these products will automatically include your affiliate code.

 Furthermore, products you reference will be automatically added to your profile shop. To remove a product from your shop, simply click the heart icon twice (first to add the product, then to remove it).

 In the user settings, there's also an option to prevent products from being added to your profile unless they are explicitly marked with a heart.
 Step 5: Managing Your Shop
 Products in your profile shop are automatically categorized based on their assigned departments.

 If you wish to adjust the names of any categories, simply access the products within that category and modify the associated department list.

 Step 6: Unlocking Advanced Features with Social.Gifts
 If you want to take your shop to the next level, consider setting up Social.Gifts website. In just a few clicks, you can launch your very own dedicated *.social.gifts website, showcasing your expertly curated product recommendations. This venture opens up a realm of additional revenue streams beyond affiliate earnings. Check out the next tutorial on how to get started (COMING SOON).

 Conclusion
 With your curated collection and expert recommendations, you're not only set to enrich the social shopping experience, but also to be at the forefront of a dynamic Web 3.0 era where collective knowledge and collaboration redefine the way we shop and engage online. Let your knowledge shine in this new era of online shopping. Happy curating!

Lesson 12:

For more details give a link to https://www.waivio.com/object/mev-launching-your-social-shopping-website/page

Are you ready to take your online presence to the next level?

Now you can transform your user profile on Waivio into a dedicated website. This transition allows you to feature your affiliate shop as the main store on your website, while your personal blog will take center stage as the key newsfeed.
Why launch a social shopping website?
Launching a website unlocks new income streams. You will gain access to four sources of revenue:

- Affiliate commissions from referrals (3%-10%);

- Beneficiary commissions (5% of author rewards);

- Referral commissions (7.8%+ of sponsored rewards);

- Advertising revenue from Google AdSense integration
Moreover, launching a website gives you the freedom to organize and customize your social shop in any way you envision.

You can customize your website to match your branding, including the logo, main banner, and website colours.
As the website owner, you have full control over the objects displayed on your website. On Waivio there are consensus rules that determine which version of objects to show (decided by the balance of votes), so if your vote is not strong enough certain objects may not appear as you want them to be in your profile shop. In contrast, on the website you have the ultimate control where your vote cannot be challenged. You can also grant administrative privileges to other users that you trust.
Another handy feature is the ability to search for all the items you've marked with a heart on your website.

Plus, if you use the Waivio Chrome Extension to upload products from Amazon to Waivio, these items will automatically appear on your profile and, consequently, on your website.

Your website visitors will be able to log in, post, comment, and upvote posts, follow other users, manage their wallets, and utilize many other tools available on the Hive social blockchain.

Let’s launch your social shopping website!

Step 1: Choosing a name for your website (or linking an existing domain)
Let's begin by navigating to the "TOOLS" section, then under "Websites," click on "Create." Choose "Social.Gifts" from the template options. Think of a sub-domain name that encapsulates the essence of your shop. For example, my shop is focused on baby products for new parents, so I'll put the baby.social.gifts. If the domain is available, proceed to read and accept the terms and conditions and click on "Create new website".
Custom Domain: If you have your own domain that you want to use for your social shopping website, choose “Custom Domain” instead. Select Social.Gifts as the website template. Enter your existing domain. Important: Your domain should be configured according to the instructions provided prior to launching it. For further instructions on setting up and connecting your personal domain please review the attached article.

And that's it - let's check out the website. As you can see, we already have a fully functional website!

By default, your website is created using your own profile, including the profile logo, shop, and blog. However, you can customize it even further to match your brand.

After refreshing the page, you'll find settings and configurations for your new website.

Step 2. Configuration
In the Configuration section, you'll have the opportunity to customize your shop's appearance.
2.1 Color
Choose the colours for your text and buttons that align with your brand's aesthetics.

2.2 - 2.3 Desktop and Mobile Logo
Next, if you want to change your logo, upload both your desktop and mobile logos to ensure a consistent look across all devices.

2.4 List Default Images
If a website has products organized in categories but doesn’t have specific images for them your user logo will be used as a default image. You can change upload a new image in "list default images" section.

2.3 Main Banner
Let's add a banner to be displayed at the top of all website pages. Here I am using an image I generated with Midjourney (Use the --ar 16:4 command to create narrow banners in MJ.)

2.4 Base Object
In the "Base Object" section, you can choose to link your website to a specific user profile or even a public object on the Hive blockchain.

By default, it's linked to your own profile, and as a result, the information from your profile is transformed into a dedicated website, including your shop and your blog.
If you are looking to launch a themed website, you can easily create an advanced shop with just a click of a button by leveraging existing projects with thousands of products carefully organized in categories. And once you add affiliate codes, all of these thousands of products will include your codes in the purchase links.

For example, let’s use an existing business object called the Camping Checklist https://www.waivio.com/object/7ujfq-shop“
” (lbm-camping-checklist) which has hundreds of categories and thousands of camping-related products listed. By simply setting it as the base object for my site, my entire website will instantly become one of the most comprehensive camping sites out there.
Another example is the “

Coffee Time

” object (3urenj-coffee-shop), which also includes thousands of coffee-making products, serving accessories, various types of coffee and even books. As you can see, these advanced websites not only feature product catalogs but also include information pages (like the Checklist) and community newsfeeds.

One more example is the “

Clean Girl Aesthetics

” object (tlc-clean-girl-aesthetics), which features thousands of make-up and beauty products that align with clean girl aesthetics.

As the list of objects continues to expand with more people creating websites, please see the descriptions to explore other existing projects: https://www.waivio.com/object/ewg-social-gifts-projects/webpage

If your desired topic for your affiliate website isn't covered here, you can create your own business object, this will be explained in the Advanced Shop Tutorial.

2.5 Default Hashtags
A default hashtag will be automatically added to all new posts created by users on your website.
This feature is particularly beneficial for websites employing custom newsfeeds that display posts with specific hashtags only. A default hashtag helps guarantee that users won't overlook adding the tag, ensuring their post appears on the website.
If your website doesn't utilize custom newsfeeds, you can leave this field empty.

2.6 Website Header
You can also customize the website header, such as changing Baby.Social.Gifts to your brand name or a short message.

Step 3. Settings
Let's move on to the "Settings" section to fine-tune the functionality of the website.

3.1 – 3.2 Language and Currency
Here, you can select the language and currency for your website. If you want to

market your website in a specific location, you can choose your local language and currency; otherwise, English and USD are solid choices.

3.3 Google Analytics 4 Property ID
Next, you can add your Google Analytics 4 property ID to get detailed reports and insights into the performance of your website, such as website activity, visitor count, geographical distribution of your audience and other metrics. You can get this ID by creating a Google Analytics account for your website. Then just copy and paste the ID, and you will see your website statistics in your Google Analytics account.
If you want to track conversions on your website, you can use the "buy_now" event. To configute it go to Admin -> Data Display -> Events -> turn on the “buy_now” event.
Buy_now is triggered every time a visitor clicks a button that takes them to an affiliated site, such as Amazon, Walmart, Target, or any other.

3.4 Beneficiary Payment
When your visitor receives upvotes for the posts they publish on your website – you can get a commission on their author rewards. In the following section – indicate which account would receive such commission and how much commission you want to collect (this value is set to 5% by default).
3.5 Referral Payment
You can also earn a commission when your visitors participate in sponsored campaigns, such as when they write a review for a sponsored product. Again, choose the recipient account.

If a product in your shop gets a sponsored reward - it will automatically be reflected on your website - you don’t need to do anything on your part. Your visitors will be able to see all the sponsored products and submit their reviews on your website to get the reward.
Sponsors define the commission levels provided to all parties assisting them in facilitating transactions. The referral portion of the sponsored rewards is set at a minimum level of 2.8%, but it can be higher for specific campaigns. In combination with the 5% author rewards, your total commissions from sponsored rewards will be 7.8%. Please refer to the referral policy for more information.

3.6 CLICK "SAVE" to save your settings, and your selections will be applied to your website.
Step 4. Affiliate Codes
Now let's move to affiliate codes. Just like you did for your profile shop, search relevant affiliate programs and input your affiliate codes.
This integration ensures that all your products in your shop come with your affiliate codes, giving you the opportunity to earn with visitors every purchase.

It's useful to occasionally check that your affiliate codes are active, especially for Amazon, since the codes can expire if a certain threshold in sales is not achieved. That's the beauty of this interface because, unlike other platforms, if your code expires, here, you won't need to update it individually for every product. Just update it one time here and it will automatically be applied to all your products.

Step 5: Website Hosting
To keep your website up and running, there are hosting fees associated with maintaining your online presence on Social.Gifts. When you're ready to fund your website, navigate to the "Manage" tab, where you'll find the button "Pay Now." Here choose the amount you can transfer in WAIV tokens to pay the hosting fees. WAIV tokens will be converted to USD at the current market rate. Click Continue to sign and finish the transaction.
For hosting prices check the info in the section. Currently, for active websites, the plan starts at 1 USD/day, which includes up to 200 daily visitors. There is an additional fee of 0.005 USD per day for every extra active user. If you want to retain your website name without running the website, a fee of 0.20 USD/day is applied. You can change the status of your website by checking or unchecking the checkmark under the "active" column.

What's next? 😉
Now that your configuration and setup are complete, it's time to reveal your Social.Gifts shop to the world.

Congratulations on launching your very own Social.Gifts website!

Your carefully curated collection, within the immersive Hive environment, is ready to offer visitors a unique social shopping experience.

Your Social.Gifts shop is equipped with a range of features that make social shopping on your website possible. From dynamic newsfeeds to visitor posts and reviews, your shop has become a lively community hub. It's not just about browsing – it's a space for connection, sharing, and discovery.

Step 1: Discovering Your Shop's Theme
The foundation of a successful shop lies in its theme. It's time to brainstorm and identify what resonates with you and your potential customers. Whether it's camping products, baby products, fitness gear, makeup, or any other niche, pick a theme that aligns with your interests and expertise.


https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1700516628_69860ab8-1af6-42c3-a8b7-573312af69f8

Step 2: Creating a business object
To organize your shop effectively, we will need to create a business object specifically for your shop. If a similar-themed website already exists, you can search for it and open the existing business object. Then, you can contribute to its development by adding more products or categories to it.

However, if you're starting from scratch, click the "write post" button and under "Create New Object," click on "business". Assign a name to your business – it can match your website, such as "baby.social.gifts". Click on the link to open the newly created business object in a new tab.

Step 3: The Main Menu
A business object has its own menu. When this object is linked as the base object on the website, this object's menu will be shown as the main menu on the website. For our object, the first menu item will be a Shop.

Click "+Menu item", then "Create new object"

https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1700520368_49682807-4879-473a-84a2-9de9dbadbe1f

We will create a new object with that name and select "list" as its type because the shop will contain links to other lists, products, or pages.

https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1700520480_4e5dd8e8-8bf3-4fe5-b9f7-5973dba9a70b

Later in this Shop list, we can create other sub-lists (subcategories), such as Clothing, Food, and Nursery.

The next menu item will be a Bookstore. This is also going to be a separate list with links to books related to our topic.

If you want some help to establish categories for your website, you can use ChatGPT. Use a prompt like "Suggest categories and subcategories for an online [your theme, e.g. fitness] shop.", and ChatGPT will give you some ideas. You can review the categories generated by ChatGPT and select the ones that align with your vision.

Step 4: Adding Lists with Products
4.1 Setting Up Your Lists
Let’s start with creating categories in our Shop. It's empty right now, but let's add our higher-level categories to it, such as clothing, feeding, and nursery. To add a category, click "Create new object".

https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1700520525_5fc0ffb1-8621-4511-aa3c-56fd5ab36d3a

Write the name of the category, such as "Nursery", and again choose the "list" as the type, since our category will have subcategories such as beds, mattresses, storage solutions, decor and so on.

https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1700520545_d9717490-925b-42ac-b6ae-ac3c80cca6bd

If you already have lists created, you can add them by searching for them in the search bar.

4.2 Establishing Subcategories
After adding all the general categories, we can add subcategories to organize the shop's inventory even further.

For instance, let's add subcategories to "Nursery,". Click on the category– you will see that now you are in "My Shop -> Nursery".

Here, we can repeat the process: click "Create new object", write the name of the subcategory such as "Decor", and choose a "list" as the type.

Similarly, you can create sub-subcategories. For example, decor can be further broken down into wall stickers, posters, carpets and so on.

4.3 Adding Products
When a category is specific enough and doesn't need a further breakdown, you can add products to it. For example, you can add products by searching for them in the search bar.

https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1700520616_f93b1ea0-dce3-4d82-846c-88bfecd8243a



If you can not find the products you want to add to your website here, you can easily add them using the Waivio’s Chrome extension. Check out the tutorial on the extension for more details.

If you want to add multiple items, you can check out the series of tutorials on importing products on the Hive blockchain to learn a quick way for bulk importing.

You may also find using chatGPT helpful to find the best products for the shop. For instance, a prompt like this: "Provide a list of top 20 products according to user reviews for [your product category, e.g. baby mats]". And ChatGPT will generate a list of products you can choose from.

To add products, search for them by name or ASIN number. It is receommended to record ASIN numbers of products during the data import, as product names can vary while product numbers remain constant. Then, click on the product and click “Submit.”

4.4 Launching a website with our business object
To launch a website using this business object - navigate to "Tools," then under "Websites," click on your website's name. In configuration, replace the base object with the business object we've just created.

4.5 List Avatars
Now our products are nicely organized in categories. However, the categories appear rather dull with default images as icons. Let's change that and add some images!

Head over to the business object and click on the category, such as "Nursery." Click on the hyperlink at the top to open the category list in a new tab. Here, you can easily add an avatar image to your category (list).

Click "Edit," navigate to "Settings," and click on "Avatar." Upload your image or provide a link. For instance, here, I used an AI-generated image from Midjourney. Click "Submit," and that's it!

https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1700520736_9cf55c56-0a61-4450-bfbb-e14e39cecdf9

Let's add images to other categories. All the images I am uploading were generated by Midjourney – if you are curious to learn how check one of our tutorials about using AI tools for creating great-looking shops.

Now that you know how to add lists of products - you can experiment with how you arrange them on your website. For example, https://coffeetime.social.gifts has three lists with products "Equipment", "Accessories", and "Coffee". Whereas https://GoCampingList.com – has all the products under "Shop". It also has a menu item called "Books". Bookstore is a list of "book" type objects.

In addition, camping.social.gifts has other menu items, such as a Checklist, which is a simple page with information. Camplife is a newsfeed with posts about camping. Legal is a list of pages added to all websites hosted by Waivio. Legal page is added automatically to all websites but you can also add your own legal documents in a similar way. Let's add these elements to our website.

Step 5: Adding a Bookstore
Let’s start by adding a menu item called "Books" that will contain top books for children and parents. Click "Create new object" and enter "Books" as the name. For the type, select "list". Once the list has been created, you can add categories to it, such as "Parenting books", "Baby board books", and "Storybooks".

Then, let’s add some books. This is a very similar process to adding products - just search for the ASIN number of the book and click “Submit”.

Step 6: Adding pages
Let’s also add a page to our website with a checklist of all the baby products every new parent should have.

Add a new menu item, click “Create new object” -> enter a name as it would appear on your website menu, e.g. “New Parent Checklist.” For the type – choose “page”, and click “Confirm”. Then, you can add content such as an article or a checklist – then just click “Ready to Publish” and “Submit”.

https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1700520764_ee85d679-8418-4ac7-982d-4b8efe428bb2

Step 7: Adding a custom newsfeed
Let's move on to custom newsfeeds. Hive is an active social blockchain where many users create posts on various topics. We can filter relevant posts using hashtags that match the topic of the website.

The easiest way to add a custom newsfeed is to click on “Write post” button and choose "newsfeed" from the selection.

https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1700520798_f3603977-91f4-435d-8183-da02652bda72

Enter a name, such as “Community”, We will link this newsfeed to our business object later after we are done configuring it.

To configure the newsfeed, open this newsfeed object in a new tab.

Click on "Edit", then click on "Newsfilter."

Here, you can add filter rules to display only a specific type of posts:

https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1700520825_54f68fa3-d008-42f2-85e2-79574d994b24

For example, for my website, I can add a "baby" hashtag in Filter Rule 1. And click "Add new rule" to add a "parenting" hashtag in Filter Rule 2. This will show posts that have these hashtags.

You can also filter out certain posts. For example, I don't want to see posts that are related to "animals" that might have a "baby" hashtag in them. So I will put "animals" in the Ignore Rule.

Another way to personalize your news feed is by choosing the type of object (e.g., a book, a product, a place, etc.) And only the posts related to that category will be displayed on your newsfeed. For example, to show all the posts on baby and parenting products, I can add "product" in this field.

To show baby and parenting posts only from specific users, I can add these users in the “users field”.

If you want to show all the posts of a specific user, like your dedicated channel, then remove all the other filters and just add that user.

Now to link the newsfeed to our business object – let’s open our business object. Click on Menu item. Enter a name for the newsfeed as it would appear on your website's menu. In the search bar, look for your newsfeed by a name or a permlink. There might be a lot of objects with the same name, so I recommend searching by the premlink, as it is a unique identifier of the object. It’s located on the object’s link after object/ e.g. this is the object's link https://www.waivio.com/object/5xjmmi-community and the premlink is 5xjmmi-community

Click "Submit" once the object is found.

Step 8: Adding widgets
If you want to integrate Google Forms, Calendly, or other external tools with your website, you can do so by adding widgets.

Click on “Write post” button and choose a "widget" from the selection – enter a name, such as “Contact Form”.

Your widget will now be created. We will link it to our business object later.

 To configure the widget, open it in a new tab.

In the widget object window, click "Edit"; under "Widget", click to add a "Form".

For example, let's add a Google Form. Have the link ready.

First, add a title (such as,"Contact Form"). Under columns, you can choose how much space you want the form to fill. For example, if you choose a middle column, the form will fill only the middle column, but if you choose "entire width" the form will fill all three columns. For Google Forms, I recommend selecting Middle + Right. Then, select the form type – a link or a widget. For Google Forms, select a link. Then, copy the Google Forms link and paste it into the space provided. Then click Submit.

https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1700521015_fcf8e859-7ced-4796-a48e-183628314b7a

If you want to paste the widget embed code instead of the link, then select "widget" as the form type and enter the widget embed code in the space provided. Here is the website where you customize your widgets: https://elfsight.com/widgets/

https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1700521032_62d0f984-8c57-48ff-9bdf-9e2c32f5a5f3



Let’s link the widget to our business object –open the business object. Click on "Menu item" and enter a name for the widget as it would appear on your website's menu, in the search bar – look for the widget by a name or a premlink. Click "Submit" once the object is found.

Step 9. Sorting
Finally, you can change the order of menu items as they would appear on your website. Click on "Menu sorting", drag and drop to rearrange the menu items in the desired order. Click "Submit".

You can also sort the items inside the categories lists. Lists have their own sorting option. Open the list in a new tab – “Edit” – under “List” click on “List Sorting” – and rearrange the items in the desired order.

By integrating categories, feeds, informative pages, and more, we've transformed the website into a fully functional and captivating platform. While I made some suggestions for the website structure, you can arrange your website any way you envision.

Authorization & Registration
To log in to the Waivio platform or related sites, open the website, click the Sign in button in the header, and choose the appropriate authentication method.
User types:
- Hive-user - the user has the right to use all the functionality of the application. A Hive-user is a user registered through HiveSigner and uses HiveSigner or HiveAuth (Hive Keychain) for authorization.
- Guest-user - a user authorized through social networks. The user does not have access to the following functionalities:
- creating campaigns;
- Voting Power = 0.
- The guest username is distinguished by the prefix "waivio_" before the name: @waivio_username.


Authorization via HiveSigner
Authorization takes place through the trusted HiveSigner system, Waivio does not store, transfer, and does not use user keys. Only temporary keys (Access-Token) generated by hiveSigner are used. Hive uses a hierarchical key system to keep you safe. You can register on the website https://signup.hive.io, after registration the user will have a hive account. After registration, a password and four private keys with different permissions are issued:

Owner - Change Password, Change Keys, Recover Account;
Active - Transfer Funds, Power up/down, Voting Witnesses/Proposals;
Posting - Post, Comment, Vote, Reblog, Follow, Profile;
Memo - Send/View encrypted messages on transfers.
For authorization in the Waivio system, you can use a password or private keys. 2021-02-08_17-40

Authorization via HiveAuth
Users can log in using the HiveAuth service via Keychain. Upon clicking the Hiveauth button, the user needs to enter their name and click 'Sign in'. A modal with a QR code opens. The user then accesses the Keychain application on their phone and scans the code and confirms the authorization.

Social authorization
Authorization via social networks is also available (guest-user):
- Google



How do I enable two-factor authentication?
Hive, like other blockchain platforms, operates on a decentralized security model. The security primarily relies on private keys for account access and transactions. If a user's private keys are secure, their account is secure. The inherent security model of blockchain reduces the emphasis on traditional 2FA mechanisms.
In the blockchain space, users are expected to take personal responsibility for their security. This includes securely storing private keys, using hardware wallets, and following best practices for online security. The emphasis is on user education and responsibility rather than providing additional layers like 2FA.

Are there any fees for using the site?
Using the site itself is generally free, including basic actions like posting, commenting, and voting. However, there are some functionalities that may require payment. For example, users might need to pay for running a site or purchasing a VIP ticket for enhanced features. Additionally, blockchain network transaction fees may apply when performing operations such as transfers.
If a user wants their vote to have significant impact and to potentially receive rewards, their voting power should be backed by an amount of WAIV or HIVE tokens, or preferably both. Users should review the terms and conditions of the specific services they use for any applicable fees.

How can I report inappropriate content or users?
Ways to eliminate inappropriate content or users:
- Downvote a post: Users can downvote a specific post by clicking on the three-dot menu on the post and selecting "Flag post." This can reduce the rewards that the post might receive.
- Hide a post: Users can hide a post so that only they will not see it. If the user has site permissions (moderator, administrator, owner), the post will not be shown on the site.
- Mute a user: Users can mute another user by opening the user's profile, clicking on the three-dot menu near the "Follow" button, and selecting "Mute." This allows you to block the user, preventing you from seeing their posts and imposing other restrictions.

What tokens can I earn?
User can earn WAIV, HIVE, and various other Hive Engine tokens. Some of these tokens can be swapped to SWAP.LTC, SWAP.BTC, SWAP.ETH. Once swapped, they can be withdrawn to wallets: BTC, LTC, and ETH.


What information do I need to provide to sign up?
To sign up, visit signup.hive.io. There are a few options for creating an account:
- Purchase an account: You can buy an account directly.
- Free account: You can create a free account using your email or phone number.
- VIP ticket: You can buy or use a received VIP ticket for an anonymous account (available on WAIVIO -> Tools -> New accounts page).


What should I do if I forget my password? Or how do I recover a hacked account?
The recovery account functionality is not available on the Waivio platform. You may consider using other Hive platforms that offer this feature. Generally, account recovery is a complex procedure, and there is no guarantee of success. It is strongly advised to securely store your passwords and keys.

__________

The structure of the Waivio platform is divided into 5 main categories for logged-in users:
1. My Feed: This section includes different selections and feeds of posts, such as Trending (posts with the highest rewards), Hot (posts with the largest number of comments), and News (newest). It also features personalized feeds like "My Feed," which shows posts from users and objects the user is subscribed to. Additionally, there are sections for Earn (rewards from sponsors the user follows), Notifications (recent notifications), and separate posts from objects and users.
2. Earn: Pages in this section display current rewards divided by regional availability (Global, Local). It includes reserved rewards authorized by the user (Reserved), a list of sponsors and their payment obligations (Receivable), and a history of reward reservations (History). Users can also create and manage campaigns under tabs such as Create (campaign creation) and Manage (campaign administration, balance control, activation/deactivation, and campaign history). Other tabs include Payable (list of users who completed campaigns and their financial responsibilities), Reports (view reports on user campaigns), Reservation (history of reservations including user and campaign status), Messages (communication with campaign executors), Fraud Detection (list of fraudulent campaigns), and Blacklist (prohibited users from campaign execution, references, and whitelisted users).

Select a logo and banner.
Set a base object (the main menu of the website will be created using the base object).
Set a default hashtag.
Enter the website name.

- Administrators: Add administrators. Administrators have the deciding right to approve or reject object updates on the website. If several administrators vote on the same update, only the last vote stands.
- Moderators: Add moderators. If a moderator flags a post or comment, that content will not appear on the website. If a moderator mutes a user, none of that user's content will be displayed on the website.
- Authorities: Add authorities. Any Hive user can declare responsibility for the accuracy of an object by claiming authority over it. They exercise their authority by approving or rejecting object updates. If full ownership authority has been claimed, only approved updates will be processed. The website owner can specify which authorities to trust (claims of other users will be ignored). This mechanism can be used to add controlled lists of objects to the website while ensuring their accuracy.
- Muted Users: List of muted users. Website moderators can mute users. Posts, comments, and the profile content of muted users are not accessible on the website. The website owner can also mute users, but only the moderator who muted a user can unmute them.

5. About: This section provides the main information about the platform, including tutorials, the whitepaper, and news.

A common issue with publishing product information on multiple websites from the same record on the open Hive blockchain is that this content will be exactly the same across various sites, and search engines generally do not favor duplicated content. Waivio uses a system of [canonical links](https://www.waivio.com/@waiviolabs/improving-seo-with-canonical-links-for-hosted-websites) on all hosted sites, giving credit to the original source of content, whether it's a user post, profile, or an object.

However, there is now an interesting alternative.

## Introducing Descriptions Bot

One product on the Hive blockchain can actually have multiple names, titles, descriptions, and other fields. In the case of an image gallery, it may show multiple images at the same time, while for a description field, only one version will be used—the one that collected the most Approve votes. This will be the version of the description that appears on Waivio and other hosted websites.

However, the website owner's vote holds decisive power within the information space of their own website. If the owner approves a different version of the product description, that version will be displayed on their website, even if another description was selected as the overall winner in the general consensus.

This means the same product can be presented differently on Waivio and the hosted site, making it possible to present to users and search engines unique versions of the same product.

Descriptions Bot can automatically rewrite descriptions for all products referenced in a chain of lists, starting from the top list and including all other embedded lists. Descriptions Bot uses ChatGPT to rewrite names and descriptions of all the products, as well as titles and descriptions of all the lists themselves. This way, you can effortlessly ensure that your website presents unique content for indexing by search engines.

To initiate the Descriptions Bot, open Tools (1) and select Descriptions Bot (2) in the Data Management section. If this is the first time you are using Descriptions Bot, you will need to authorize it (3). Once authorized, you can click on Rewrite Descriptions (4), specify the list, and begin the process.

Please note that each update (revised description, title, or name) requires a minimum upvote of at least $0.01 value in WAIV tokens. You can specify the minimum voting power (30% is the default value). Once the VP on your account falls below that value, or if the voting power is below $0.01, the process will slow down, waiting for the voting power to restore (it automatically restores at the rate of 20% per day).

You may launch this bot for multiple lists simultaneously. Progress will be monitored in a table. Jobs can be paused or resumed at any moment by changing the job status in the 'Active' column. Completed jobs will then be transferred to the history table.

Descriptions Bot allows website owners to effortlessly improve their search engine rankings with original content, making their site content more discoverable in search engines.

We're excited to introduce a new feature that enables you to add custom signatures to your comments. This tool is particularly beneficial for enhancing interaction within the topical community feeds on your site.

**Customizable Signatures:**
You now have the capability to create a signature in your profile, which will automatically appear in all your comments. This signature can include a link to your website along with a brief tagline, offering a consistent presence in discussions.



![image.png](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1701310210_63c63cc8-ec9d-4049-81b5-9f254f914c3d)



***



**Engagement in Community Feeds:**
Community feeds are dynamic environments for discussion and sharing experiences. With your custom signature, you can subtly highlight your website while engaging in these conversations. This approach allows you to connect authentically with users, maintaining visibility for your website in a non-intrusive manner.



[#socialgifts](https://www.waivio.com/object/socialgifts) [#websites](https://www.waivio.com/object/websites) [#community](https://www.waivio.com/object/community) [#marketing](https://www.waivio.com/object/marketing)


Every website has unique needs. Some prefer community-driven content, while others opt for post-moderation by admins.

Now, the 'Object editing by users' option in the Social.Gifts website settings allows you to further strengthen your control over site content. With this option, you can ensure that only content approved by your administrators appears on your website.

![image.png](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1700231012_938089fa-d9b7-4ac6-8de9-96cbc66a0aab)

To activate:

1.  Click 'Tools'.

2.  Go to 'Settings' for the selected website.

3.  Enable the 'Object editing by users' option.

With this new feature, you retain full control over the objects displayed on your website (like lists, products, pages, etc.), ensuring that everything published aligns with your vision and standards.

Alternatively, if you prefer full **control over specific objects** but want to allow the community to make changes and add new information to others, your admins can claim 'Authority: Ownership' for these specific objects.

![image.png](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1700248547_2b9dfbcb-638a-42c9-9063-bedeafc0cfd1)

To claim full authority over an object:

1.  Open Object, swithc to Edit mode.

2.  Click + on Authority field.

3.  Claim Ownership authority over the object.

Ensure that the account used for authority claims is recognized as an administrator on the website, and that this user has approved all the necessary fields for that object.



**P.S.**
As an experiment, @coffee.time enabled this option for the [https://CoffeeShop.Gifts](https://coffeeshop.gifts/) website and quickly realized that the list of admins needed to extend beyond the core team. It now includes all users who contributed to the project at various stages. The list turned out to be quite extensive!

[#socialgifts](https://www.waivio.com/object/socialgifts) [#website](https://www.waivio.com/object/website) [#admin](https://www.waivio.com/object/admin) [#socialshopping](https://www.waivio.com/object/socialshopping)


Website owners on \*.Social.Gifts have full control over product searches on their individual websites. Search results include only the objects specifically claimed by the website owner or approved authorities.

![image.png](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1691448303_488afaa7-0806-4bb4-9e15-ea4de1060551)



If a team of admins is actively adding products to various lists throughout the website, these products won't appear in search results until they have been properly claimed by the owner. Simply adding all admins as authorities won't solve this issue, as admins might be involved in multiple projects. Including all of their products in search results could lead to a clutter of irrelevant products appearing.

For small numbers of products, website owners can claim each product one-by-one. However, this approach becomes challenging when dealing with a large number of products.

## Introducing the Claim Authority Tool

Waivio is proud to offer an efficient solution – the Claim Authority Tool, now available in the TOOLS / Data Management section.

![image.png](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1691448593_ad3428f8-1c16-44b1-8a9d-4a51db6080ef)



Simply enter the top-level list, and this tool will assist you in claiming authority for all products referenced in embedded lists, including all product options.

![image.png](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1691449221_ae688a13-2e65-45ab-b5ed-17c3bd4281dc)



By doing so, you ensure that only relevant products appear in the search results on your website.

![image.png](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1691449530_147816d5-befc-4a4e-8e4f-a991126df23f)



This tool significantly eases the task of managing product search on your \*.Social.Gifts website, ensuring the best possible user experience.

[#socialgifts](https://www.waivio.com/object/socialgifts) [#socialshopping](https://www.waivio.com/object/socialshopping) [#website](https://www.waivio.com/object/website) [#hosting](https://www.waivio.com/object/hosting) [Waivio](https://www.waivio.com/object/ylr-waivio/page#oal-about-waivio)


It is easy to grant administrative privileges to your entire Social.Gifts website. But what if you want to give these privileges only to specific products or business listings on your social website?

Now you can allow specific users to manage individual objects without having general admin privileges across the entire website.

### Why This Matters

This feature is particularly useful for website owners who want to allow business owners to manage their own listings. Similarly, it can be used to allow partners to keep information about their products updated to ensure consistency and reliability of product information.

### How It Works

In the Settings section of any object, you'll now find a "Delegation" field. Here, you can specify accounts to delegate admin rights to.

![image.png](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/e5351d2f89d8b07451e63e20558cdb3618646141fd8becde36acc92a733481a4)



### Example in Action

Consider @coffee.time, a website owner of [CoffeeShop.Gifts](https://coffeeshop.gifts/), delegating rights to @demo.account for a specific book: Brew:Better Coffee At Home.

![image.png](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/d02d021250cba8fccc34b355c76c48d36d76e2f462ff93a0635ce2f75ce453af)



When @demo.account signs in to [CoffeeShop.Gifts](https://coffeeshop.gifts/), they see an Edit button on that listing. Any edits made to this specific object by @demo.account are reflected on the site.

![image.png](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/dba9f8754c861fe00917aeeba1743b56cd3d492cfdf8a6deda86035535720876)



In a practical scenario, @demo.account updated the price of the book to $32.88. This edit is visible on the website. However, if @demo.account attempts to make changes to other objects, those changes will be ignored, maintaining the integrity and security of your site’s data.

### Get Started Today

To take advantage of this new feature, simply navigate to the Settings section of the object you wish to delegate admin rights for, and enter the account you wish to delegate to in the "Delegation" field. It's that simple!

As always, we welcome your feedback and are here to support you every step of the way.

We are excited to share the results of performance enhancements for social shopping websites hosted on Social.Gifts. Our development team has been implementing key optimizations that have drastically improved response times, ensuring a faster and more seamless experience for all users.

![image.png](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1712952738_988a2535-6f79-4413-bb46-c07c7722af87)



#### Phase 1: Baseline Performance

As of January 2024, our Google Crawl Data Report indicated that the average response time for websites hosted on our platform was over 1 second. We recognized this as an opportunity for improvement and initially focused on enhancing our platform architecture.

#### Phase 2: System Architecture Optimization

In February, we rolled out significant changes to our system architecture. By optimizing our server configurations and enhancing our network protocols, we successfully reduced the average response times to 400 ms. This marked a substantial improvement, making website interactions quicker and more efficient, which is crucial for maintaining user engagement in the fast-paced world of social shopping.

#### Phase 3: Introduction of Smart Caching System

In March, we introduced a smart caching system specifically tailored to optimize performance for search engines. This innovation helped further reduce the average response times to below 100 ms.

## Accessing Crawl Stats Report

To check the Crawl Stats Report for your social shop, please log in to your [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console) (the same place where you [submitted your website sitemap](https://www.waivio.com/@social.gifts/sitemaps-now-integrated-into-all-social-gifts-websites) for accelerated indexing). First, open 'Settings' (1), then select 'Crawl Stats Report' (2).

![image.png](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1712961607_94fe9d35-6784-47af-8658-f663c3056a30)



On the report page, select the 'Average Response Time' parameter (3) and deselect all other parameters. You can then hover over a specific day on the chart (4) to see the average response time for that day.

![image.png](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1712962045_101c2fdf-b7a1-45de-81fd-43010695dbcb)



## Understanding Response Times

A good response time for websites, as measured by the time it takes for a server to respond to a request (often referred to as "Time to First Byte" or TTFB), varies depending on the type of content being delivered and user expectations. Here are some general guidelines and industry standards:



**Under 100 ms:** Excellent server response time, typically expected for high-performance, optimized sites that use effective caching strategies and are hosted on efficient infrastructure.

**100 ms to 200 ms:** Good and common target for many web services, suggesting optimal server configuration.

**200 ms to 500 ms:** Average response time, considered acceptable for most contexts, but there is room for improvement, especially in competitive industries or high-traffic sites.

**500 ms to 1 second:** Poor response time, which might not severely impact user experience for certain types of content like large media files where overall loading time is more relevant, but it's generally advisable to investigate and mitigate causes of delay.

**Over 1 second:** Considered unacceptable for commercial websites. Delays of this magnitude typically result in poor user experiences, increased bounce rates, and could negatively affect search engine rankings.



We thank you for your continued support and trust in Social.Gifts. Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to refine and expand our services.

[Waivio](https://www.waivio.com/object/ylr-waivio/page#mim-transform-your-passion-into-profit-with-waivio) [#socialshopping](https://www.waivio.com/object/socialshopping) [#socialgifts](https://www.waivio.com/object/socialgifts) [#hosting](https://www.waivio.com/object/hosting) [#website](https://www.waivio.com/object/website)


We're pleased to inform that sitemap.xml files have been implemented across all \*.Social.Gifts domains. Find an example at <https://coffeeshop.gifts/sitemap.xml>.

Sitemaps are crucial for search engine optimization (SEO), ensuring that product and category pages are accurately indexed and more readily accessible to users via Google search.

For example, after adding the sitemap link to the Google Search Console, we noticed a spike in the indexing of CoffeeShop.Gifts webpages by the search engine.

![image.png](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1698095338_4130768c-43a1-40b3-8cac-5c44794558d7)



To initiate the indexing of your sitemap, first access the [Google Search Console](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home#utm_source=en-wmxmsg\&utm_medium=wmxmsg\&utm_campaign=bm\&authuser=0). For first-time users, the Console requires a one-time verification process to authenticate website ownership. The process is relatively straightforward if your domain is registered through CloudFlare.com or GoDaddy.com.



Once in the Console, navigate to the 'Sitemaps' tab. Here, you can add your sitemap by entering the URL: <https://yoursite.name/sitemap.xml>.

![image.png](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1698098091_f762ebaa-f230-4460-8850-78c03997a188)



This integration reinforces our continuous commitment to enhancing the search engine visibility of \*.Social.Gifts websites. We welcome and value insights from our community on further SEO improvements for our websites.

[#socialgifts](https://www.waivio.com/object/socialgifts) [#website](https://www.waivio.com/object/website) [#seo](https://www.waivio.com/object/seo) [#google](https://www.waivio.com/object/google)


Starting today, you can add cryptocurrency addresses to businesses and restaurants, making it easier to generate crypto invoices and accept digital payments. This can be accomplished on Waivio.com or directly on a Social.Gifts web3 site (if you have admin privileges).

![image.png](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/503fa9fb1ed6b9903a8e7704879c54e5da2eb694f84cd05b1c74ae489146e62b)



### How to Add Crypto Addresses to Your Business Listings

1.  Open the business or restaurant listing.

2.  Switch to Edit mode.

3.  Click "+Wallet".

4.  Provide a title (e.g., "Pay with Bitcoin," "Litecoin Donations").

5.  Select a cryptocurrency: Bitcoin (BTC), Hive Backed Dollars (HBD), Bitcoin Lightning, Litecoin (LTC), and more.

6.  Enter the crypto address.



![image.png](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/4276ad33f9768b2df58711236e1372c0b29b5097624b6b576a3a21010d10e0d8)



### Seamless Payment Process for Users

Once the crypto payment options are added to the business listing, users can:

1.  Select the desired payment option and enter the amount they intend to transfer.

2.  The system will generate a QR code based on the entered amount and address.

3.  Users can then scan the QR code with the HiveKeychain app or another wallet, depending on the cryptocurrency they intend to transfer. They can verify the address and amount before confirming the transaction.

![image.png](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/b312498f28186e1351e3538eff066bb402fd7e371e43867da424ce833c532b20)



### Note to Social.Gifts Website Owners

Please consider restricting data editing features on your websites to approved data admins and business owners who have received delegations to edit specific listings.



Stay tuned for more updates and features as we continue to enhance your experience on Social.Gifts web3 sites and Waivio.



[Social.Gifts](https://www.waivio.com/object/uxp-social-gifts/list) [#socialgifts](https://www.waivio.com/object/socialgifts) [#socialshopping](https://www.waivio.com/object/socialshopping) [#web3](https://www.waivio.com/object/web3) [About Waivio](https://www.waivio.com/object/ylr-waivio/page#mim-transform-your-passion-into-profit-with-waivio)



By default, website owners on \*.Social.Gifts hold a greater voting authority compared to any administrators they may have added via the 'Settings'. This additional authority is designed to provide website owners with the final say on all object updates within their sites.

However, there's a flip side to this power. Specifically, it prevents administrators from making corrections to products imported by the website owners.

![image.png](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1690657040_6590ec19-45f4-4be9-8302-4a9921c65b77)

We've listened to your feedback, and introduced a new feature that allows website owners to add themselves to the list of admins, thereby equalizing their vote with other admins. As a result, admins can override updates made by website owners when necessary.

![image.png](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1690657272_6adaae76-ce26-4d31-b31b-12562819e164)

If you wish to return to your superior voting status, simply remove your name from the list of admins.



[#socialgifts](https://www.waivio.com/object/socialgifts) [#socialshopping](https://www.waivio.com/object/socialshopping) [#website](https://www.waivio.com/object/website) [#hosting](https://www.waivio.com/object/hosting) [#affiliatemarketing](https://www.waivio.com/object/affiliatemarketing)


When a user with admin privileges logs in to a \*.Social.Gifts website, they will now see an 'Edit' button on product pages.

![image.png](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1690612916_726d3eaa-d187-4c4b-8c49-6b68c7bc62ef)



Website owners and registered admins no longer need to visit Waivio.com to make small edits to products.



![image.png](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1690613174_9f5320c1-37a8-4600-84b3-6bf3ea8ac06d)



A vote on an object update by an authorized admin carries decisive weight on a specific website. However, on another website or on Waivio.com, that user's vote might not hold the same influence, leading to the same product appearing differently across various platforms.



This is why it's important to be able to edit objects within the context of a specific \*.Social.Gifts website.



![image.png](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1690613992_3c83e691-aab3-4bb6-a232-a52467a3fabf)



In the 'Updates' section of an object, updates approved by the website owner or admin are prominently highlighted.

\#socialgifts [#hivedev](https://www.waivio.com/object/hivedev) #socialshopping [#website](https://www.waivio.com/object/website) [#hosting](https://www.waivio.com/object/hosting)


In an effort to enhance visual appeal, informational value, and search engine optimization (SEO), social shopping sites are now incorporating titles and descriptions into their product categories and sub-categories.

![image.png](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1697297277_29ee6a56-bb3e-4b41-9611-ea65845c157e)

The process of adding titles and descriptions to categories (lists) is similar to that of adding avatars.

First, navigate to the category you wish to enhance with a title and description.

Then, open it in a new tab. It's crucial to open the list in a separate tab to make changes to that list.

Once in Edit mode, you can add an avatar, title, and description to the list.

![image.png](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1697297336_c3b10c90-7e18-4917-9012-b757481d0b88)



When designing titles and descriptions for categories, it may be beneficial to incorporate search terms and keyword combinations that individuals are likely to use when seeking resources related to your website's topic. Numerous tutorials are available online about SEO optimization of web pages for search engines.

[#socialshopping](https://www.waivio.com/object/socialshopping) [#socialgifts](https://www.waivio.com/object/socialgifts) [#seo](https://www.waivio.com/object/seo) [#shopping](https://www.waivio.com/object/shopping)



Now that you've launched your social shopping website, it's crucial to inform search engines about its existence. Actively submitting your site to search engines is a key step in increasing its visibility. This proactive approach not only expedites the indexing process but also lays the foundation for generating organic traffic to your new site.

### Google Search Console

<https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home>

\- Use DNS TXT record to verify website ownership. This method is recommended as it doesn’t require adding extra code to your site.

\- Once verified, submit your sitemap (<https://coffeeshop.gifts/sitemap.xml>). This can be done under the Indexing/Sitemaps section in Google Search Console.

![image.png](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1701585882_52d042fb-5949-4707-934f-cb51f6f76737)



### Bing Webmaster Tools

<https://www.bing.com/webmaster/tools>

\- Import your site from Google Search Console to Bing Webmaster Tools, making the setup process easier.

![image.png](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1701585663_95f34c50-eff3-4440-a666-c2280f4d3d08)

\- Submit your sitemap in Bing Webmaster Tools, which will also cover Yahoo, as they use Bing's index.

### DuckDuckGo

DuckDuckGo does not require direct submission. It automatically indexes the web using over 400 sources, including Bing. Therefore, submitting your site to Bing also helps with DuckDuckGo indexing.

### Additional Search Engines

Here are some more platforms where you can submit your site for indexing. This list includes a mix of general and niche search engines:

The latest update to the Waivio Chrome Extension (version 1.2.3) introduces support for product imports from Walmart.com and Sephora.com to the Hive blockchain. Just open the product page, click the extension, and choose 'Upload to Waivio.'



**Walmart.com** - offering a wide variety of affordably-priced goods from electronics and clothing to groceries and home essentials.

![image.png](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1697742582_8e36007e-f0f3-428c-abad-a2b209b747d7)



**Sephora.com** - Sephora.com is a premier online cosmetics and beauty retailer, offering an extensive array of makeup, skincare, haircare, and fragrance products from a multitude of high-end brands.

![image.png](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1697747656_3d5d01c9-c6a1-4036-9ff5-0e58b54b5d06)



Additionally, both stores feature affiliate programs. After obtaining affiliate codes from them, you can input these in your user profile settings. For those managing a \*.Social.Gifts website, you can add these affiliate codes directly into the website settings as well.

Waivio's Chrome Extension (v 1.4.0) now integrates directly with [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps) and [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/), enabling users to upload information about businesses, restaurants, and cafes onto the Hive blockchain. This enhancement streamlines how users discover, share, and engage with their favorite places.



### Upload from Mapping Services in One Click:

Add listings from Google Maps and OpenStreetMap to Waivio effortlessly with a single click through the Chrome Extension.



### Integration with User Profiles:

![image.png](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1708721490_ce9dbba2-05d0-4efd-ac8c-90e5eab31245)



Businesses uploaded can be favorited on Waivio profiles, creating a personalized catalog of preferred spots.



### Community Engagement:

![image.png](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1708723201_7479db40-7e3c-433d-a7a5-ddec5f5faaae)



By referencing your favorite businesses in your Hive posts, your stories and insights gain a special place on their pages, bringing your content to the forefront. This not only elevates your experiences but also positions you as an expert for these places.



### Getting Started:

To import information from Google Maps, obtaining an API code is necessary. It is [straightforward to acquire](https://www.waivio.com/object/jiw-google-maps-integration-set-up-an-api-key/page) and free for small volumes.



Make sure to update to the latest version of the Waivio Chrome Extension to access these new features.



### Spotlight Your Favorites:

Discovered a restaurant that captivated your senses? With Waivio, you can now spotlight these cherished experiences in your profile, turning your personal favorites into hints for the community. Your story could be the key to unlocking someone else's next great adventure.

As Waivio prepares to roll out web hosting services, some administrative tools are being released.

Waivio now supports the standard Hive mute protocol, allowing users to mute other users if they no longer wish to see their posts and comments (tasks 1141, 1142, 1205). The mute function can be engaged on user profiles.
<center>![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1612897383_ec59ed02-73af-46d2-b794-f6768ace1b77)</center>

In the future, if a website moderator mutes a user, their posts and comments will no longer be visible to all visitors and users on this site.

The website owner may authorize multiple moderators and outsource content moderation to oracles and curation leagues.

### Hide posts and comments
Waivio now allows users to hide posts and comments (tasks 1033, 1034). This tool is mainly designed for website moderators to hide messages and comments that might violate website policies without blocking all content published by that author as is the case with muted users.
<center>![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1612900801_d6020cab-7c15-432b-a93f-5e1dc8354274)</center>

### Sponsor rewards in posts
Users can now see the amount of liquid rewards paid for the post by a sponsor (task 962). This payment is now included in the total post payout amount.
<center>![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1612906743_845b1b4d-ff1d-4852-85f5-36d1c69389b1)</center>

### Widget for referrals
Referral partners can now integrate Waivio rewards directly into their websites using a widget (Referrals/Instructions) and collect referral commissions from new users (for a period of 90 days) and existing users (for 5 days). Tasks 1120, 1128, 1129.
<center>![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1612908368_ac3a8cde-0324-4102-bad2-da20493dbaf8)</center>

### GitHub task management
Waivio's development team is now using open GitHub for ongoing task management. Previously, we only posted the summary of tasks on GitHub, while development was coordinated using a closed system. Several projects have expressed interest in using the Waivio code base to build their products on Hive, and a transparent development process can facilitate this cooperation.
<center>![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1612901811_2df43ca5-6c68-41d1-9d1e-95d4487da4a0)</center>

Waivio Labs will be using GitHub Wiki to publish detailed documentation.

Traditional companies try to protect their intellectual property to gain a competitive advantage. But Waivio's approach is very different. We believe that by giving full access to our code, our users and our knowledge base (accumulated and shared via the Hive blockchain), together we can achieve scale that we can't achieve on our own.

This is Business 3.0, it is designed for rapid, permissionless scaling and innovation.

## Other updates:
1. Profile / Wallet - exclude transfers to self from the report (960);
2. Flagging posts - allow users to select the power for their downvotes (1015);
3. News feed in objects - should be visible if button is at the top (1107);
4. Fraud prevention - display reference codes on cases (1110);
5. Display rewards cards to anonymous visitors as well (1119).

**Exciting news for all social shop owners and shopping enthusiasts!** Waivio has rolled out an update that significantly lowers the barrier for publishing product updates on the Hive blockchain. With a remarkable 10X reduction in upvote requirements, it's now easier than ever for users to share and manage extensive product catalogs.



![image.png](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1715288913_bc6bdd6f-4919-4eff-8ff8-3ae31a3f30ae)



### What's New?

Previously, the threshold to upvote object updates on Waivio required a minimum of $0.001 WAIV Power per update. Now, this requirement has been slashed to just $0.0001 per update (Tasks: [6644](https://github.com/Waiviogit/waivio/issues/6644), [6645](https://github.com/Waiviogit/waivio/issues/6645)). This strategic change is specifically designed to empower social shop owners and merchants by allowing them to publish ten times as many updates about products, businesses, pages, lists, and other objects with the same amount of WAIV Power as before.

### Why the Change?

This update was prompted by the increasing demand from social shop owners who are keen to expand their online collections with a broader range of products. Additionally, merchants looking to publish their product catalogs on the Hive blockchain can now do so more frequently and comprehensively. This enables their affiliate partners to more effectively create and manage social shops, leveraging a larger variety of products, engaging larger audiences, and accumulating reviews through Waivio’s open architecture.

### Data Import Tools

Waivio continues to streamline the process of blockchain-based catalog management with its efficient [Data Import Tools](https://www.waivio.com/object/ylr-waivio/page#6vcmab-tutorials/uxp-social-gifts/uiy-how-to-import-products-on-hive). Merchants can now easily export their product catalogs to a JSON file that complies with Waivio's data schema. This file can be effortlessly uploaded using Waivio’s Data Import tool. For existing products on the blockchain, only changes will be identified and published, ensuring that product details remain accurate across all social shopping websites.

### Waivio Chrome Extension

For added convenience, Waivio offers a special [Chrome Extension](https://www.waivio.com/object/ylr-waivio/page#6vcmab-tutorials/uxp-social-gifts/kda-waivio-chrome-extension-tutorial) for social shop owners. This tool simplifies the process of uploading product information from major e-commerce platforms like Amazon and Walmart. Users simply navigate to a product page, activate the extension, and the product details are automatically uploaded to the Hive blockchain and integrated into the user’s social shop. This feature is very useful for adding new products as well as for keeping product listings up to date with minimal effort.

### The Impact

This reduction in upvote requirements is a strategic move by Waivio to accommodate the growing needs of social shop owners. By facilitating more frequent updates, Waivio enables a vibrant, continually evolving online shopping experience.

Waivio is introducing custom domain names for social shopping websites.

Previously, users were restricted to launching websites under the \*.social.gifts domain. This update allows for the use of custom domain names, providing more flexibility and branding opportunities for website owners.

![image.png](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1701392083_06a110d1-8478-4b2e-b00a-1dfbd800a5e0)

#### Domain Protection via Cloudflare

All custom domains must have a robust DDoS protection. This service is provided by Cloudflare.com at no additional cost and is known for its effectiveness in safeguarding websites against DDoS and other attacks.



#### **Domain Configuration Requirements**

Before launching a new website with a custom domain, certain configuration steps must be completed:

\- [General Instructions](https://www.waivio.com/object/qym-custom-domain/page): Domain configuration via GoDaddy, Cloudflare.

\- [Secure Connections](https://www.waivio.com/object/qym-custom-domain/page#pvs-ensuring-secure-connections-manual-https-configuration-for-custom-domain-on-cloudflare): Enforcing the use of HTTPS protocol.

\- [Smooth Redirects](https://www.waivio.com/object/qym-custom-domain/page#ckq-ensuring-smooth-redirects-manual-www-to-apex-domain-setup-on-cloudflare): Forwarding from 'www' to the apex (primary) domain.



#### New Domain Registration

For those who do not yet own a domain name, purchasing directly through Cloudflare.com might be a cost-effective option.

![image.png](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1701452512_c85f2d19-5cbc-4b9c-99cc-d541ecd1c7bf)

Additionally, domains purchased through Cloudflare are automatically hosted on their nameservers, which ensures DDoS protection and simplifies the setup process.

We are pleased to announce that \*.Dining.Gifts websites hosted by Waivio have been given a fresh new look.

At Waivio, we understand the importance of maintaining a consistent and professional online presence. That's why we have designed \*.Dining.Gfits websites to be easily customizable, giving you the ability to tailor the look and feel of your site to match your brand's colors, focus on your desired location, use your preferred language, and display prices in your local currency.

\*.Dining.Gifts websites are designed with convenience in mind, providing visitors with a user-friendly search function that allows them to quickly and easily find the restaurants and dishes they are looking for. With the ability to filter their search results by location, cuisine, and ingredients, visitors can easily find exactly what they are looking for and view any rewards associated with their choices.

Our "Submit Dish Photos" wizard makes it easy for users to share photos of their dishes and claim any associated rewards. The process is simple and straightforward, consisting of just three steps. First, users select the dish they want to share photos of. Next, they upload two or more photos and add their comments. Finally, they submit the post and collect the rewards.

Rewards for sharing dish photos on \*.Dining.Gifts websites are paid in liquid WAIV tokens. In the first week after publication, users can collect likes from the community, which can increase their rewards even further.

Rewards earned through sharing dish photos on the \*.Dining.Gifts website can be instantly converted from WAIV tokens into popular cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, and HIVE. This allows users to easily access and use their rewards in a way that suits their individual needs and preferences.

When you add a hashtag [#waivio](https://www.waivio.com/object/waivio) or [#waiv](https://www.waivio.com/object/waiv) to your posts, you make your post eligible to receive WAIV rewards in addition to HIVE rewards. Such posts are highlighted and marked with a Waivio logo:

![image.png](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1672790344_a7de4358-8472-4586-a674-2baca07de51a)

By clicking on the total earnings, you can view further details such as the breakdown of earnings in WAIV, Hive Power, and HBD, as well as the beneficiaries and their share of the earnings. You can also see the total number of rewards received by all curators.

One key difference between WAIV and HIVE earnings is that WAIV rewards are paid in liquid form, while HIVE earnings are paid as a 50/50 combination of Hive Power (HP) and HBD (there is also an option to receive 100% of HIVE rewards in HP). This means that you can immediately access and use your WAIV rewards, while HIVE rewards in the form of Hive Power must be converted to liquid HIVE through a 13 week power down period.

Waivio simplifies the process of exchanging your WAIV earnings for popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, and HIVE. With just a few clicks, you can quickly convert your WAIV or pay directly for goods and services.

All crypto conversions are performed on a decentralized exchange built on the second layer Hive-Engine blockchain.

[Waivio](https://www.waivio.com/object/ylr-waivio) [#hivedev](https://www.waivio.com/object/hivedev)


Waivio takes a significant step forward in addressing a common challenge faced by all our hosted social shopping sites—duplicate content originating from the Hive blockchain. Each site hosted by Waivio mirrors the same comprehensive array of information from the Hive blockchain, including user profiles, posts, objects, products, and more. This widespread duplication poses a unique problem: search engines like Google struggle to identify the original source of this content, often leading to confusion and inefficiency in search rankings.

### Introducing Canonical URLs:

To combat this issue, Waivio is excited to launch a system of canonical URLs. This system serves as a direct communication line to search engines, clarifying which page is the authoritative source of the information.

#### How It Works:

If a new post is submitted via a hosted website, such as [https://CoffeeShop.Gifts](https://coffeeshop.gifts/), all other websites, including [https://waivio.com](https://waivio.com/), will use canonical URLs to reference back to the post on the originating website.

This method significantly improves the ability of search engines to identify and prioritize original content, enhancing the SEO of the originating website.

### Benefits for Website Operators and Hive Users:

**Improved Search Engine Rankings**: By posting more original content through their websites, operators can gain better positioning in search engine results.

**Incentives for Onboarding New Users**: The canonical address for user profiles is determined by the origin of their first post, making it advantageous to onboard new Hive users through your website.

**Complex Attribution for Objects**: The canonical attribution for objects is a bit more intricate. The 'Description' field is pivotal in this process. If a user who posted a winning description hosts their website, canonical links will point to that object on their website from all other sites where the product is displayed with that description.

Each product can have multiple descriptions, with separate attributions calculated for each version.

### Selecting the Website:

*   Users with multiple hosted websites can designate which site should receive all the canonical credits for objects.

*   To configure, navigate to Tools, Websites - Manage, and select the website for canonical attribution. Remember, only one website can be the primary recipient of canonical referrals.

By posting original content on your hosted website, and encouraging your users to do the same, you can significantly enhance your site's search engine rankings. This improvement is driven by other websites pointing back to your website as the canonical source. Additionally, onboarding new Hive users and adding more products and objects further increases the number of inbound references, improves visibility in search engines, and brings more visitors.

Waivio is presenting a novel way for Hive users to monetize their shopping insights and passions.

Just as your blog posts appear in your Hive profiles, you now have the opportunity to establish an affiliate shop, allowing you to list and recommend products to others.

![image.png](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1691298663_2ea64206-f115-4987-b663-e2aca7e642d1)



Every user can now has their own Affiliate Shop in their Waivio profile, and it is entirely free.

## Here's how it works:

### Heart Your Favorites:

Simply mark a product with a heart or mention it in a post, and it's instantaneously added to your shop. No fuss, no hassle!

![image.png](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1691299647_c574fff8-1798-47c1-b9e0-cb49bc89b8e6)

### Add Affiliate Codes:

After the successful introduction of the [public shop feature in user profiles](https://www.waivio.com/object/ylr-waivio/page#mim-transform-your-passion-into-profit-with-waivio/fjh-shops-in-user-profiles), many of you reached out with a fantastic suggestion: the ability to showcase your favorite businesses, restaurants, and places in a similar, personalized manner. We're excited to announce that we've made this idea a reality with the launch of the Favorites section in user profiles on Waivio!

![image.png](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1706909361_036aec2e-04d7-474b-ab58-ffde1eeb4640)



#### How It Works:

Adding an item to your Favorites on the Hive blockchain is as simple as can be.

Whenever you find a spa, café, park, or any place that captures your heart, just hit the heart icon, and it will automatically be added to your Favorites section.

![image.png](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1706911457_1a110756-46d3-4f96-8398-f463b536191d)



Additionally, if you reference any business, restaurant, place, or page in your posts, Waivio will automatically add it to your Favorites section in your profile. This happens seamlessly, keeping your Favorites list fresh and up-to-date with your latest discoveries and recommendations. If you would like to remove it, you can toggle the heart icon on and off.

#### Start Sharing and Discovering:

With this update, your Waivio profile becomes an even more powerful tool for sharing and discovery. By simply posting about the places and businesses you love, you're creating a curated list of recommendations for your followers and the broader community. As you explore other users' content, you'll find new favorites among their shared experiences.

#### Future Developments:

We are exploring ways to make it easier to add businesses and other objects to the Hive blockchain. Our goal is for these entries to serve as a repository for [accumulating knowledge](https://www.waivio.com/object/ylr-waivio/page#6vcmab-tutorials/jpv-accumulating-knowledge-on-hive) and community reviews about experiences, destinations, and ideas.



Currently, you can utilize the [Waivio Chrome Extension](https://www.waivio.com/object/ylr-waivio/page#mim-transform-your-passion-into-profit-with-waivio/kda-waivio-chrome-extension-tutorial) to add products from Amazon, Walmart, Sephora to the Hive blockchain with just one click. We're excited to announce that the latest version of the Extension now also supports the import of businesses and restaurants from OpenStreetMap.org.



Here at Waivio Labs, we are exploring a number of interesting applications of Web3 for building social shops and other themed social websites.

[Waivio](https://www.waivio.com/object/ylr-waivio/page#oal-about-waivio) [#hivedev](https://www.waivio.com/object/hivedev)


Waivio has added support for a new object type called a "widget," which allows for the integration of third-party pages, forms, and other widgets onto the Hive social blockchain (tasks [4434](https://github.com/Waiviogit/waivio/issues/4434), [4406](https://github.com/Waiviogit/waivio/issues/4406)).

This means that users can now easily incorporate external content, such as [Coingeko's widgets](https://www.coingecko.com/en/widgets), into their Hive posts and objects. This can add a new level of interactivity and functionality to Hive, making it easier for users to share and access a wider range of content and resources.

![image.png](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1670693107_0a1f46bb-d071-4e62-ab03-c89b571a7a5f)

Let's create a new widget called **Crypto heatmap** on Waivio:

![image.png](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1670693961_15faeb24-50ba-4e6c-accb-a8a3e9cb69fd)

To incorporate a Coingecko widget into your Hive widget, simply copy the widget's code and paste it into the form:

![image.png](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1670695530_54460da0-c636-4146-848e-37797bc76eaa)

Now users can easily find [Crypto heatmap](https://www.waivio.com/object/krd-crypto-heatmap) [undefined](https://www.waivio.com/object/krd-crypto-heatmap/widget)widget by searching for it on Waivio, reference it in their posts, as well as integrate it into other objects on Hive or into their social websites.

![image.png](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1670696387_0a6df9f3-c37b-4ca0-999d-6faaf989d425)

This can greatly enhance the user experience on Hive, making it easier for users to share and access a wider range of resources and information. The widget object type allows for the seamless integration of interactive forms, tools, and pages from external parties, making Hive a more dynamic and engaging platform for users.

## Other updates:

Waivio users can now rate products and companies with a single click.

For example, a restaurant can be rated by value, ambience, service and food:
<center>![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1655652905_98883de8-77c3-49c3-bba6-8c5b62954505)</center>

Other types of businesses and products may have their own rating systems. For example, individual dishes can be rated based on presentation, taste and value.

To vote, simply click on the stars. Your vote will be recorded on the Hive blockchain. As long as you're logged in, you'll see your votes as a reminder of your personal experience with that product or company.

Task: [2773](https://github.com/Waiviogit/waivio/issues/2773)
## Linking posts to objects
The standard method of linking posts to objects is for the author of a post to include references to those objects or hashtags in the post.

But if the original post did not have such links, other users can now link that post to objects, by posting top-level comments with links to objects. And once the post is linked to those objects, the post will appear in the Review section of those objects' pages (task: [2699](https://github.com/Waiviogit/waivio/issues/2699), [2813](https://github.com/Waiviogit/waivio/issues/2813)).

For example, if a user posted a review of a product or company at a time when those objects did not exist, but were created later, other users can now add comments to the original post and link it to the newly created objects.
## Other updates:
1. Rewards / Create - sponsors can now set the target currency for their rewards campaigns, allowing for better presentation of rewards in local currency ([2782](https://github.com/Waiviogit/waivio/issues/2782), [2786](https://github.com/Waiviogit/waivio/issues/2786));
2. Rewards / Reports - financial reports can now be viewed in local currency ([2811](https://github.com/Waiviogit/waivio/issues/2811), [2812](https://github.com/Waiviogit/waivio/issues/2812));
3. Notifications / Route - notify users about changes of withdraw routes for their accounts ([3054](https://github.com/Waiviogit/waivio/issues/3054), [3055](https://github.com/Waiviogit/waivio/issues/3055), [3056](https://github.com/Waiviogit/waivio/issues/3056), [3057](https://github.com/Waiviogit/waivio/issues/3057)) ;
4. Posts / Odyssey - users can add Odyssey videos to their posts ([3444](https://github.com/Waiviogit/waivio/issues/3444));
5. Posts / YT shorts - users can add YouTube shorts to their posts ([3720](https://github.com/Waiviogit/waivio/issues/3720));
6. Posts / Photos - preserve meta data for images uploaded by users ([3751](https://github.com/Waiviogit/waivio/issues/3751));
7. Object / Titles - the field was extended to allow up to 500 symbols ([3462](https://github.com/Waiviogit/waivio/issues/3462)).

We're excited to announce a significant security enhancement on Waivio with the integration of HiveAuth. This update, inspired by direct feedback from our Hive community, introduces a seamless sign-in and transaction management experience through the widely recognized [Hive Keychain app](https://hive-keychain.com/).

### How It Works:

**Install Hive Keychain:**

Begin by downloading the Hive Keychain app onto your smartphone. This secure app will store your active and posting keys, keeping them safe and accessible.



**Seamless Sign-in Experience:**

Simply select the HiveAuth option on Waivio.com, enter your username, and a QR code will appear.

If you have favorite authors on Hive and want to upvote their posts every time, you can now set up a match bot to do so automatically.

Step 1: Open **Rewards** > **Match bot**s > **Authors**
<center>![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1631919207_3141795e-9616-4ef2-8800-a7d1745fbbea)</center>

Step 2: Authorize the match bot to make upvotes on your behalf. Please note that this operation requires an Active key.

Step3: Create a rule for each author you would like to upvote every time they submit a post on the Hive blockchain.
<center>![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1631920026_c90f2817-00ed-4d0a-a7d9-c23fc37a325a)</center>

a) Find the author, whose posts you want to upvote automatically;
b) Specify the value of your vote (1%-100%);
c) Set the minimum vote mana - votes will only be cast if the voting power is above the specified threshold;
d) Specify the expiration date for this rule. If no date is provided, this rule will remain active until it is manually deactivated.
<center>![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1632014672_98a3ca7c-8fad-4b7b-816a-663e9314565b)</center>

Important:
The Authors match bot only issues votes with an estimated value of 0.01 HBD or greater.

### Curators match bot
Users can now follow trusted curators and automatically upvote (or downvote) posts (and comments) in the same way.
<center>![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1632013384_e6bce18f-0f41-46ac-915b-2c5fddf8ce9e)</center>

a) Find a trusted curator to follow;
b) Set the voting ratio (1%-1,000%) with 100% for the exact match of curator's votes. Please note that Curators bot only casts upvotes with an estimated value of 0.01 HBD or greater.
c) Check this box if you also want to match the curator's downvotes;
d) Check this box if you want to match curator's votes on comments;
e) Specify the threshold for the voting mana - votes will only be cast if the vote power is above the selected threshold;
f) Set the expiration date for this rule. If no date is provided, this rule will remain active until it is manually disabled.
g) Add some notes.

In June, Waivio launched [Telegram notifications](https://www.waivio.com/@waiviolabs/waivio-update-june-20-2020), allowing users to receive instant mobile notifications and monitor multiple Hive accounts. And now Waivio offers a tool to configure which notifications to receive (task 712):

<center>![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1596665563_e7327a86-4f65-427f-b61d-87cc8a37827c)</center>
For incoming HIVE transfers, users can set the threshold (minimum amount in USD) for notifications, allowing them to ignore small transfers, which are often used for promotional messages.

Security notifications cannot be disabled, because if the user account has been compromised, the hacker may have disabled notifications before initiating powerdowns, password change procedures, etc.
## History of reward reservations
Now users can see the entire history of their reward reservations and filter them by the status (ex., completed, released, expired) and by the sponsor (task 582):

<center>![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1596666334_c598a897-f235-47af-840a-ff2400bbbad4)</center>

Reservations are now also used for direct communications between users and sponsors (task 585). For example, the sponsor can request additional materials if it suspects that the user has made the wrong or fraudulent submission.

Waivio offers a special tool for managing customer communications (open/closed tickets):
<center>![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1596669000_70b13ea8-d567-4f12-a0fa-b0df59a0c53c)</center>

## Blacklists
Waivio now supports blacklists (task 617) allowing sponsors to exclude certain users (1) from their campaigns, for example in cases where the sponsor suspects that the user is engaged in fraudulent activity.

<center>![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1596669511_df23616d-fcaa-4058-932b-521d52e36b87)</center>
Sponsors can reference other blacklists (2), which they trust, and maintain whitelists (3) which can be used to override the referenced blacklists for selected users.

1. Editor - allow copy/past for images (382)
2. Reward cards - multiple statuses: expired, completed, flagged, etc. (579)

Waivio now offers social website hosting services!

And our first website template is Dining.Gifts. Several independent guides already launched their fully interactive Hive websites on Waivio, including [https://Van.Dining.Gifts](https://Van.Dining.Gifts) by @Van.Dining
<center>![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1616564881_0a5567cf-cb4b-4843-be87-4f71b461bf01)</center>

Visitors to your Dining.Gifts website can search the map for restaurants and even dishes. For example, a quick search for dishes with the keyword "tuna" will show all tuna dishes in nearby restaurants:
<center>![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1616565912_862ccc04-01ed-4e6e-80fe-1876bb3d3900)</center>

Launching a website just takes a few minutes. Find the Website/Create button under the TOOLS, select Dining.Gifts template and the name for your website:
<center>![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1616566668_c6342951-3509-45b6-a0c6-cc4a7df228a5)</center>

Once the name of your site is reserved, you can quickly specify some basic parameters, select the area of the map to focus on, define the administrators and moderators for your site and launch it!
<center>![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1616567270_1254aa95-1613-4cbd-b377-f5fe7d9207f5)</center>

It costs just 0.005 HBD per unique visitor per day (min. 1 HBD/day) to host an advanced social website. And the best part is that your social website comes with a solid business model: as the website owner you earn 7.8%+ from all the restaurant rebates collected by your visitors, when they share 2+ photos of dishes from participating restaurants:
<center>![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1616568117_3cb4dde8-4db2-42f3-8a9d-c6be0714e448)</center>

So, if you are a foodie and you have some social following on Instagram or any other social platform, you can launch your own branded social site in minutes and start to earn commissions from the restaurant rebates collected by your followers!

Welcome to decentralized and permissionless Business 3.0!

### Integration of blogs into business pages
The easiest way to provide a high impact news about your business is to integrate a Hive blog directly into your business page ([1975](https://github.com/Waiviogit/waivio/issues/1975))
<center>![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1616563799_febfd0fc-2f13-46b6-a3c9-eec1925b3d1b)</center>

You can use the Custom Sorting option to place the Blog button in the first position and make your news feed the first option visitors will see, when they open your Hive business page.

Hive Hardfork 24 proved to be much more difficult than expected (Tasks 837, 1021, 1022, 1027, 1028, 1029, 1030, 1031, 1032, 1063).

Some of the changes were discussed and anticipated, such as a new chain identification number. But there were other changes that were not widely discussed, such as the freezing of the post and comment vote count after 7 days.

Previously, votes after 7 days had no influence on payments, but they were still counted, so authors could always see if their content was appreciated by the community in the long run. But this is no longer the case.

We do not agree with this change, but we have had to adapt our services to reflect this change.

Now we invite users to pay tips to the author:
<center>![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1605126822_a2e64137-6db3-4e3f-b7b4-17f65ea0dd47)</center>

The same change had an even greater impact on the Object Reference Protocol, which was based on the same open public voting process for managing object updates. For example, if a user has updated the address of a restaurant, other users can review and either approve (upvote) or reject (downvote) the proposed change. If the user has made a valuable contribution, they could potentially receive author rewards, while other users would receive curation rewards for reviewing and confirming the proposed changes during the frist week.

As votes can no longer be counted beyond the initial 7-day window, Waivio introduced another protocol using Json records on the Hive blockchain to administer the approve/reject process. From the user's point of view, the voting process now works as before, except that contributors no longer receive any benefit for their efforts to improve the wiki records on Hive.

Now that the Waivio platform is stable again, we could explore a hybrid approach to voting on updates, combining the open voting process for the first 7 days and moving on to Json records after that.
## Other updates:
1. Sponsor notifications - new reservations (954);
2. Page objects - new presentation (972);
3. Discover - highlight objects with rewards on the map (988);
4. Campaigns - introduced a threshold for non payments (1013);
5. Object cards - include top-voted tags (1020);
6. Drop down menu - new format, order and links (1060, 1061);
7. Wallet - history of power ups to different accounts (1064).

## Bug fixes and minor updates:
469, 594, 831, 923, 943, 966, 968, 969, 973, 974, 977, 978, 979, 980, 982, 983, 984, 985, 986, 987, 989, 991, 992, 994, 995, 996, 997, 998, 999, 1000, 1001, 1003, 1005, 1007, 1008, 1009, 1010, 1011, 1016, 1023, 1024, 1025, 1026, 1036, 1038, 1040, 1043, 1045, 1046, 1047, 1049, 1050, 1052, 1054, 1057, 1059, 1080, 1082, 1085.

Waivio makes it easy for guests not only to join Hive and receive rewards, but also to withdraw their earnings and convert them into Bitcoin, Litecoin or Ethereum (679, 767, 771, 772, 773, 774).

Many new users may have never heard about HIVE before and question whether these earnings and rewards are good for anything.

<center>![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1595615788_7c6c8909-ea94-4279-91f6-c6a3bb886b20)</center>

Now, with just a few clicks and an email confirmation, Waivio guests can redeem their HIVE rewards using any [Bitcoin ATM](https://www.google.com/maps/search/bitcoin+atm) by scanning the QR code and sending HIVE for an instant cash withdrawal.

Details of the transaction are available directly from the wallet history (visible for the logged user only).

## Linking a Hive account to a guest account
Guests can now link a standard Hive account and set it as the beneficiary for their posts and comments (668, 751).

This way, guest author earnings and attention rewards will be automatically deposited into the Hive account they control:

Accurately predicting the value of votes on the Hive blockchain is not a trivial task. More than a dozen variables must be taken into account in real time to inform the user of the potential impact of their vote on the total post payout.

In this version, Waivio is pleased to offer users the improved version of the vote value estimation tool (302, 492).
<center>![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1593717335_42411dcc-e9bf-46eb-aba6-845f1d4e6134)</center>
In the example above, @vancouverdining upvoted a post by @jrvacation using 100% of the available voting power. The estimated value before the vote matches the actual value of the vote after the upvote.

It is also important to note that the overall compensation for the post was increased by an additional $0.02, which was allocated to the previous voters.

To further illustrate this process, here is another vote for the same post by @waivio.match account:
<center>![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1593717361_bc33c2ed-d683-43f6-b8d5-826ea1d1cff6)</center>
The value of the vote was accurately estimated at $2.35, but the overall reward for the post was increased by an additional $0.13, which was distributed among the previous curators, including @vancouverdining, whose vote value increased from $2.20 to $2.26.

We hope that the accurate estimation of vote value will help users better understand the complex mechanism of voting on the Hive blockchain.

## Security Notifications
To provide users with an additional level of security, Waivio now sends notifications on the following user-initiated transactions (670):
- transfer of funds;
- initiate power down;
- withdraw funds from the Savings account;
- set withdraw route;
- outgoing power ups;
- change of the recovery address;
- change keys.

These methods can potentially be used by hackers to steal funds from the account in case the user's active keys are compromised.

Waivio users can receive instant mobile notifications via the Telegram app using the @WaivioNotificationsBot service.

You can now receive Waivio notifications directly on your mobile phone via the Telegram app (667).

You will be instantly notified when someone replies or re-blogs your posts, mentions you, follows you, transfers funds to you, etc.

And you can track as many Hive accounts as you like!

<center>![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1592667661_cee13c07-74a0-438d-9244-fa92cb700360)</center>
- Start Telegram chat with **@WaivioNotificationsBot**
- Enter all the accounts you want to subscribe to
- Now you will receive instant mobile notifications for these accounts

Initially, this tool was developed for Waivio Guides to monitor multiple accounts and administer multiple rewards programs on the Hive blockchain.

And now, this service is available to all Waivio users.

## **Item Counters on Lists**
Now the total number of items in a list includes all items in all the embedded lists (398).

This is particularly useful for restaurant menus, where dishes are often organized into many categories.
<center>![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1592675525_98f638b2-a98b-4551-a7ec-5d1802e12c4d)</center>

## Advanced Reporting for Guides
When guides manage prepaid rewards programs on behalf of their clients, they must provide reports at regular intervals (for example, monthly) or when a certain amount of rewards has been distributed to users (463).

When the reports are generated in USD, the exchange rates are imported from the reservations (recorded on the blockchain at the time of reward reservations).
<center>![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1592677277_a6747971-c48f-4a79-81f0-e83b95c3598a)</center>

(1) Guides often manage multiple accounts and they can manage all reports in one place without switching between accounts. Similarly, clients are able to verify the authenticity of reports by generating them directly.
(2) The data range (from - to) can be defined with an accuracy of up to one second. This is important for connecting reports at the per record level.
(3) Reports can be generated for a specified budget (in HIVE or in USD).
(4) Processing fees may also be included in the reports.
(5) Reports can be filtered for any specific object.

***

## **Other updates and bug fixes:**
1. Profile / Active - when the user was active on the chain (388)

There are many parties involved in the processing of each reward, in addition to the eligible user (who has completed the task) and the sponsor (who pays the reward), such as campaign posting, rewards indexing and referral services, as well as additional beneficiaries, specified by the user at the time of posting.

Waivio now offers a detailed report of all the parties involved, their roles and their share of rewards.
<center>![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1590445655_1d078090-f306-40d8-a5b8-87100792501d)</center>


In this example:

1) @pacific.gifts (sponsor) announced the reward of 15 HIVE for 2 original photos of the Meat Platter for Two from Kisamos Greek Taverna (Richmond, BC, Canada).

2) User @foomoo [reserved ](https://www.waivio.com/@foomoo/reserve-ezzv2fijevl)the reward (met all of the eligibility requirements: minimum expertise, # of followers, # of posts, etc.) and

3) [posted](https://www.waivio.com/@foomoo/review-kisamos-greek-taverna-meat-platter-for-two) a qualifying review (2+ photos, links to the [dish ](https://www.waivio.com/object/qqp-prawn-and-scallop-fourno)and the [restaurant](https://www.waivio.com/object/kvu-kisamos-greek-taverna)).

4) The first table provides a summary of **User rewards** and their distribution among all beneficiaries specified in the post. In this example, @waivio is listed as a 3% beneficiary (the qualifying review was posted using Waivio.com).

5) The second table shows the distribution of **Processing fees** (sponsor offered 5% on top of user rewards to all the parties for hosting, indexing and processing of rewards).

Three parties are involved in the processing of rewards in a decentralized environment:
- Campaign management (posting attention bids on the blockchain);
- Rewards indexing (personalizing attention bids for users according to their eligibility and preferences);
- Referral (external marketing partners, who receive credit for bringing new users to the platform).

6) The HIVE/USD exchange rate is recorded at the time of reward reservation. It is important for transparent reporting, including for tax purposes (e.g. capital gains).

In the current example, all services are operated by Waivio (waivio posting service, waivio.camaigns, waivio.index, waivio.referrals). In a decentralized environment each service could be operated by a different party.

## Post beneficiaries
Users can now specify multiple beneficiaries for author rewards in their posts (advanced settings in the post preview):

As the number of objects in the Hive blockchain is increasing, Waivio develops tools to browse and search for them.

Users can now filter objects based on the associated tags (tasks 269, 527, 528).

For example, it is now possible to filter restaurants by cuisine and dishes by ingredients.

<center>![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1601764086_1dc168e8-e476-46b0-aa4b-d886abeacba8)</center>

## Claiming authority

In this release, Waivio introduced the process for claiming authority for objects. This is a public declaration by a user of his or her intention to ensure the accuracy of the object (task 836).

<center>![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1601761672_ee477c34-e11e-41d9-b472-1fc2bb9184e1)</center>

Multiple users may claim authority over the same object, as their claims will only make a difference when another user or website owner adds them to a list of Trusted Authorities. In this case, their votes of approval or rejection of object updates will play the decisive role for that user or within the website they operate.

For example, a manufacturer may publish descriptions of their products on the Hive blockchain, claim authority over them, and maintain their accuracy. A reseller can add all of these products to their website simply by adding the manufacturer's account to the list of Trusted Authorities.

Users can claim administrative or full ownership of the objects. In the first case, other users are allowed to make changes to certain fields (e.g. add photos to the gallery). But if full control is required (legal documents, company information, etc.) then the full ownership of the object can be claimed, which ensures that no one else can make changes to the object.

## Following sponsors

Users can now monitor all new rewards posted by the users (sponsors) they are following (task 153). Users also receive instant notifications about new rewards.
<center>![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1601762248_6ca803b4-7685-45c2-81cc-793149341a1a)</center>

*Note*: Get instant notifications through the [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) messenger (subscribe via@**WaivioNotificationsBot** service).

## Like notifications

Users now receive notifications when their posts are upvoted by important users (followed by the author or whose votes make a noticeable difference on the post payout, task 713).

## Wallet - table view

In order to facilitate the export of wallet transactions to Excel and other spreadsheets (e.g. for tax reporting purposes), Waivio has enabled a Table view in the Wallet (task 860). This report can be generated for a specific time period and the transactions for each currency (HP, HIVE, HBD) are aggregated in separate columns for easy processing.
<center>![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1601768149_c6995bea-86c9-48b9-8cb8-063c24592144)</center>



## Waivio.com website speed

[waivio](https://www.waivio.com/object/waivio) [hivedev](https://www.waivio.com/object/hivedev)

Waivio has launched a referral program (tasks 715, 1090, 1112) that offers 56% of processing fees to referring parties for a period of 90 days for new customers and 5 days for regular customers. For example, if a referred visitor opens Waivio.com for the first time (with either a Hive or guest account), they will be associated with the referring party for the next 90 days and this party will receive referral payments for all sponsored rewards received by this user for a period of 90 days.

Instructions: just add **?ref=YourHiveUsername** to Waivio.com links.
<center>![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1608052342_81aab63a-7431-4457-ad77-ebcfcba19c6d)</center>

Waivio relies on user sessions to preserve the link to the referring party until the user logs into Waivio.com. The referral is then recorded and can be viewed on the Status page:
<center>![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1608055653_3d56fb04-8a56-42bb-921c-17562d671dea)</center>

Once the user is assigned to a referral partner, they will remain associated with that party until the expiration of the referral period, regardless of the other referral links they may click during that time.

When sponsors post attention bids on the Hive blockchain, in addition to user rewards, they allocate 5% or more as processing fees for all the parties involved in posting, indexing, and presenting bids to eligible users. Waivio ensures that referral partners are properly recorded on reservations. Sponsors are reponsible for paying referral fees and the status of these payments can be verified on the Receivables page:
<center>![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1608056992_bb31e1bc-4d8a-4da8-bd63-4475f7d681d2)</center>

In this example, @foodster published a review that qualified for a $4.86 reward (39,178 HIVE at the time of reservation). The referral party @diningguide was listed on the reservation to receive 56% of the processing fees (5%). In this case, the referral fee represents 2.8% of the user's reward. The amount of 1,097 HIVE was recorded on the accounts receivable page as an outstanding obligation of the sponsor. Referral fees are paid in liquid HIVE.

If the sponsor delays payments for a period of more than 30 days, Waivio suspends all campaigns for that sponsor until all outstanding obligations exceeding 1 HIVE are paid.

The list of all active rewards campaigns can be viewed on the [Rewards / All page](https://www.waivio.com/rewards/all?ref=diningguide).

### Bell notifications for objects
In addition to bell notifications for users, Waivio now supports instant notifications for objects as well (tasks 930, 953):
<center>![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1608060853_78b87c67-a501-48cd-9534-a7d331681dfd)</center>
For example, @diningguide was using bell notifications for the #bitcoin hashtag and received an instant alert, when @tuck-theman posted a new article referencing that hashtag.

### Related images on object pages
Objects that support Galleries now have Related albums (task 975) that include the images from all the reviews that have a reference to this object:
<center>![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1608062048_1c3a0c06-96a5-4ab8-bf5d-0cde4090a0ac)</center>

### Fraud detection assistant
Waivio has launched an experimental tool for fraud detection (task 872). All qualified submissions are checked using multiple algorithmic procedures and accumulated knowledge to identify potential fraud.
<center>![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1608059635_bbeb6e83-d5f7-4c99-ba66-7dbfe9ff3d13)</center>


Sponsors should always verify submissions using their own procedures and use the Fraud Detection Assistant only as a secondary reporting tool. The service is provided on an "as is" basis.

## Other updates:
1. Object tags - sort by upvotes on object cards (645, 1019);
2. Duplicates in lists - check lists for duplicates (710);
3. Custom sorting of lists - fixes, formatting (926, 976, 1048);

In our quest to develop the most user-friendly editor for creating new posts on Hive, we are pleased to announce a number of new features and enhancements, starting with the overall look and feel:
<center>![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1599601364_b845f58f-cee4-4941-a9e7-56186c08e416)</center>

After some user testing, we decided to devote a separate field to the title and to introduce light borders around the text area (742, 824, 887, 909).

Editor is now better optimized for mobile use, including Android phones (745, 766, 870):
<center>![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1599605694_6076003b-0c8d-4baf-a25f-e96b510bb59f)</center>

It is now possible to add several images at the same time (383, 385, 652, 821, 822, 823) and use copy/paste to add images (382).

Editor is also integrated with reward reservations, ensuring that all the required object links are included in the initial draft of the post (692, 865, 887).

## Notifications bell
Waivio users can now enable notifications for the accounts they follow (669):
<center>![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1599628715_ab1e397f-3ed8-443f-ae66-d98419c044ec)</center>

Instant mobile alerts can be activated by subscribing to the **WaivioNotificationsBot** service in the [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) app.

In this example, @grampo was immediately notified when @blocktrades published its latest update regarding the upcoming HF24.

## Customer communications
Users can now communicate directly with sponsors regarding their reward reservations or completed reviews (834):
<center>![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1599630798_ac9e0477-f91e-46a6-8e91-0485af38bcee)</center>

If you started your Hive journey with a guest account on Waivio.com or Dining.Gifts (using Google or Facebook accounts), earned a few rewards, and started to get interested in creating your own social presence on Hive, it may be time for you to create a regular Hive account and take full control of your private keys, funds, and social identity. This will allow you to power up your Hive, earn curation rewards, grow the number of your followers and use hundreds of other apps on the Hive social blockchain.

It's now very easy to invite your friends to join you on Hive: you can offer them VIP tickets, which can be used to create a Hive account in a few steps. [HiveOnBoard.com](https://hiveonboard.com/create-account) offers one of the best onboarding experiences on Hive.

### Integration of forms into business objects

In addition to customizable news feeds and blogs, it is now possible to integrate Google Forms and other similar services directly into Waivio business pages (task [1977](https://github.com/Waiviogit/waivio/issues/1977)).

The form can fit in a single column, or occupy the space of the middle column and the right column, or require the width of the entire screen (1). It can be integrated using a link or a widget (2).

When you add a title or description to the object, the system tries to identify common tags for that particular object type (389). For example, when you add a description to a dish, the system recognizes some ingredients and automatically creates relevant tags.
<center>![Automated tags](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1587611642_3da616c6-c74b-4241-a002-720580540557)</center>
<center>Automated tags</center>
We continue to work on improving the object search functionality on Waivio, and these tags will be used to filter objects in search results and in map navigation.
## Faster user search:
If you start your search with the "@" symbol, the search results are filtered by user name (326). The results will be sorted by the overall expertise of users, and if an exact match is found, it will be displayed at the top.
<center>![User search](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1587581028_c79953de-7bd8-4616-9c54-963bc2c97ce9)</center>

If you want to see hashtags or other object matches, you can click the appropriate tab.
## **Other updates and bug fixes:**
1. My feed - attribution of re-blog actions (233)
2. Predictive search - proper user count and keyword result filtering (259)
3. Object page - hide empty tag categories (272)

In order to create a transparent trail of sponsors launching reward campaigns for Hive users, details of these campaigns are now published on the chain (in both .json and easy-to-read text formats) and signed by sponsors as a public declaration of their commitment to pay rewards according to the announced details (426).
<center>![Rewards campaign](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1588131710_1012f221-305f-449d-bd9e-b70d054adf80)</center>
<center>Rewards campaign</center>
And when Users reserve the reward, they are also posting public records on the blockchain confirming their commitment to write a review (427).

This establishes a legal public record of mutual obligations between Sponsors and Users signed with their posting keys.

Users can cancel their reservations by publishing signed notifications as comments to their original reservations.

It is generally assumed that Sponsors can cancel their Reward Campaigns at any time, but if there are Users who have already reserved the rewards, they should be allowed to complete their work according to the terms that were active at the time of the reservation.

## Object status notifications
All users who follow an object or have expertise in the object (earned by referencing, updating or curating it) are notified of critical Status changes (unavailable, relisted, NSFW, flagged) that affect the visibility of the object throughout the system (381).

<center>![Object status notifications](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1588127637_952ae774-f3f6-4e59-8de6-02b994a15896)</center>
<center>Object status notifications</center>
In this example @diningguide has created a "Test restaurant" object. And when @wiaviolabs changed the status of this restaurant listing to " Unavailable", @diningguide received a notification with the option to Reject this action.
## **Other updates and bug fixes:**
1. Secondary GPS - use parent GPS coordinates for child objects (291)
2. Updates - use author reputation (295)
3. User expertise - fix custom case of negative expertise (356)
4. News feed - remove duplicates (362)
5. Power down notifications (392)

<center>Accurate HIVE and HBD prices</center>
## User expertise in comments
Now Waivio displays user expertise in the comments, giving readers a better feel for the reputation of users who make these comments (376).

<center>![User expertise](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1586500908_e87a18e9-2d89-46cc-a954-494b4d72cd83)</center>
<center>User expertise</center>
Note: User expertise on Waivio is a reflection of HIVE/HBD cumulative earnings.

## Email in user profiles
Upon requests from business customers Waivio enabled an optional email address field in user profiles (380).
<center>![Public email](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1586501969_74284212-0710-4f0c-9663-89f8378470e5)</center>

User profiles can now be edited using posting keys instead of active keys. Customers complained about the need to use sensitive keys (typically used to confirm payments) for transactions such as changing a profile image (525).
<center>![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1589495048_f821f766-2d8e-46cd-8b0d-c57634fd446d)</center>

Several other Hive sites also support this new standard. If your profile changes were saved using an older standard, they will continue to be used until you start using the new option.

## Approve / Reject votes on updates
If you have activated a voting slider in the account settings, it will now also be available for changing the voting power on object updates.
<center>![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1589499456_842038f6-c1e7-48de-a98f-b00c4a0b8c22)</center>

  This can be a useful tool to adjust the power of your Approve or Reject votes.

## Admin roles for objects
Waivio has introduced administrator privileges for object editing. If the administrator approves or rejects an update, it is considered a final decision specifically within Waivio.com (470).
<center>![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1589519761_46c314e3-e3c5-4319-b809-d7edb1cbaa8e)</center>



At some point, administrator roles will be used for custom websites, which will be built using the Waivio platform. This feature can be used to ensure that the selected objects cannot be easily modified by the community (for example, contact information, legal agreements, affiliate links, etc.).

As we approach the development of a platform for hosting social sites, the roles of administrator and moderator will play even a greater role in ensuring the accuracy of the data within the managed domains.

## **Other updates and bug fixes:**
1. Object cards - display full address, when possible (312, 520)

In order to make the voting process for object updates more transparent, Waivio now displays two parameters: Approval (%) and Vote count.

**Approval** (%) is the factor that defines whether or not the update will be displayed. It can range from 0% (Reject votes only) to 100% (Approve votes only). If the Approval value is 50%, it means that this update received an equal value of approval and rejection votes. A minimum threshold of 70% is required for the update to be added to the object.

**Vote count**: This is a parameter used to sort approved updates. If a particular field can only have one winning update, it will take the approved update with the highest Vote count. For example, there could be only one icon representing the object, while there could be multiple photos in the gallery. The vote count can be positive or negative, depending on the balance of Approve/Reject votes.

For example, a user @diningguide added a phone (123) 456-7890 to an object Test restaurant:
<center>![New phone number](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1588569394_6621dc81-ba49-485a-9be3-71791de3b7ab)</center>
<center>New phone number</center>
At this stage the update has a single Approve vote by @diningguide and the update is approved (100%) with the Vote count of 0.0036.

The user can easily remove this update by simply changing their vote to Reject:
<center>![Phone removed by the author](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1588569727_b63bb8f3-36b0-4d8f-b2ad-2b66c6ff3f32)</center>
<center>Phone removed by the author</center>
In the same way the user can vote Approve again and the update will become valid again.

Waivio allows you to add up to three phone numbers to an object. So, if the user adds another phone (987) 765-4321, this time with the title "Pickup orders", both numbers will be displayed :
<center>![Second phone number added](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1588571430_1da8c512-aee8-43fe-980c-d0df29ce4773)</center>
<center>Second phone number added</center>
The Vote count for the second phone is higher (0.0049 vs. 0.0036) and it is displayed above the first number.

With each subsequent update of the object, the user gains more expertise in the object and the value of their vote increases, even though the voting power used to upvote both updates was the same.

Waivio users can earn rewards in multiple tokens for their posts, comments and upvotes, including WAIV, HIVE and other community tokens on the Hive-Engine sidechain.

Waivio makes it easy for users to track their account balance, earnings and transaction history separately for WAIV token, HIVE and all other Hive-Engine tokens in three dedicated wallet tabs (1).
<center>![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1655577714_18d57f92-eee4-4a15-a47f-9fa8b0bbb9eb)</center>

With the wide variety of tokens, Waivio wallet now supports instant swaps (2) between different tokens via decentralized diesel pools (DeFi) on the Hive Engine blockchain. One of the main advantages of these pools is the low BUY/SELL spreads of only 0.25%.

For example, you may easily swap WAIV tokens into SWAP.HIVE (pegged HIVE token on Hive-Engine, which can be instantly withdrawn into HIVE):
<center>![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1655580922_ae20c8bc-cc54-4490-9a8e-c614bfd940b4)</center>

All wallet operations must be confirmed with an active key using HiveSigner, which ensures that your private keys are stored securely (encrypted) in your browser and never shared with applications.

The Waivio wallet also allows users to deposit and withdraw all major cryptocurrencies (3), including BTC, LTC, EOS, ETH, DOGE, HIVE, HBD, and others directly via Hive-Engine gateways paying a small fee of 0.75%.

As a next step you can, for example, withdraw SWAP.HIVE to HIVE:

When withdrawing other currencies, such as BTC, LTC, ETH, you can scan the destination QR code, which can contain not only information about the destination address, but also the required amount. Waivio wallet automatically calculates all transfer fees and suggests the amount of the corresponding SWAP.xxx token that should be transferred.

For example, if you initiate a withdrawal of $20 worth of LTC via a Bitcoin ATM, you simply scan the QR code on the ATM and Waivio wallet will do the rest:
<center>![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1655582579_9863e5a0-cb90-4553-9df2-e7ac30d9a27f)</center>

You can enjoy the same convenience when paying for your coffee or any other product or service with all major cryptocurrencies directly from your Hive-Engine wallet.

## Future development

In order to simplify things even further, the wallet may even combine swap and withdraw thransactions into a single step. This way users may keep their funds in liquid WAIV tokens and pay bills in BTC, LTC, ETH, EOS and other major currencies in one click.

Waivio wallet will find the optimal way to convert WAIV into the target currency, automatically calculate all commissions, slippages and fees. And users will just need to confirm the transaction.
